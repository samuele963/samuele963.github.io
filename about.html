  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm Sam, a guy (he/him) from Italy who enjoys collecting and talking about various things!<br>
    My hobbies include collecting electronics and <a href="vintagecomp/index.html">old computers</a>, documenting
    <a href="electrics/index.html">electrical items</a> from all over the world, experimenting with
    <a href="videoart/index.html">analog video</a>, and going on <a href="transit/index.html">train trips</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    On this site I like to document my longer-running projects, in a way that people can find and discover easily.
    My most extensive project at the moment is my collection of electrical items, which spans several pages and covers
    old and new items from all around the world.
    In the future I'd also like to talk some more about analog video art, trying out different tools and setups and
    uploading videos with the results.
  </p>
  <p>
    More regular updates about my hobbies can be found on the various social media accounts listed later in this page.

  <h3>About my profile picture</h3>
  <p><img src="images/profile_pic.png" height="95" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;" alt="A picture of a video game slime character with a moustache.">
    For many years now I've been using this profile pic of a moustached rock from the video game Undertale (which I only
    recently found out is actually supposed to be a slime).<br>
    It was just a random picture I remember taking while playing the game in 2017 and I've used it on all my social media
    accounts ever since (in a few different forms), so it has essentially come to represent me, in a way.
