  <h2>The BTicino "Magic" safety plugs and sockets</h2>
  <p>
    In the 60s, the <a href="plugs_ita_old.html">plug</a> and <a href="sockets_ita_old.html">socket</a> system used
    in Italy at the time was considerably dangerous: plugs didn't have sleeved pins, which made it easy to receive a
    shock, and the sockets didn't have any sort of shutters.<br>
    Due to this, there was an increasing dissatisfaction, and the Italian company BTicino  - the most popular manufacturer
    of electrical devices at the time - tried to design a replacement which would fix those issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, the "<i><span lang="it">prese e spine di sicurezza</span></i>"" - safety plugs and sockets - were created.
    More commonly, however, they were known as the <b>Magic</b> plugs, as they were created as part of the famous
    <a href="sockets_ita_old_5.html">modular system</a>, and each socket had the word "MAGIC" on the front cover.
