  <h2>The BTicino "Magic" safety plugs and sockets</h2>
  <p>
    In the 60s, the <a href="plugs_ita_old.html">plug</a> and <a href="sockets_ita_old.html">socket</a> system used
    in Italy at the time was considerably dangerous: plugs didn't have sleeved pins, which made it easy to receive a
    shock, and the sockets didn't have any sort of shutters.<br>
    Due to this, there was an increasing dissatisfaction, and the Italian company BTicino  - the most popular manufacturer
    of electrical devices at the time - tried to design a replacement which would fix those issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, the "<i lang="it">prese e spine di sicurezza</i>" - safety plugs and sockets - were created.
    More commonly, however, they were known as the <b>Magic</b> plugs, as they were created as part of the famous
    <a href="sockets_ita_old_5.html">modular system</a>, and each socket had the word "MAGIC" on the front cover.
  </p>
  <p>
    These plugs were extremely safe for the time, and indeed are arguably even more safe than the ones used nowadays.
    The plugs were polarised, and designed in such a way that made it impossible to touch any live contacts, while the
    sockets had a special type of shutter system which was very difficult to defeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, Magic plugs were a failure - no appliances were sold with them, thus requiring the user to rewire them.
    Adaptors were also available, but obviously defeated the safety features. Additionally, their higher price limited
    their adoption to higher end installations.
    Over time, standard Italian plugs and sockets also adopted some of these safety features, such as
    <a href="safety.html#shutters">shutters</a> and <a href="safety.html#sleeved_pins">sleeved pins</a>, which negated
    the benefits of using the Magic plugs even further.

  <h3>Be careful about phone sockets!</h3>
  <p>
    The "Magic" plugs and sockets, due to their very unusual appearance, are often confused with a few different types of
    phone plugs. One of them is the French one, which is larger and has a T shape.<br>
    Even more confusingly, BTicino also had its own separate phone plug connector, which <i>did</i> in fact look very
    similar to the irreversible safety plugs. Its adoption was fairly limited, however.
