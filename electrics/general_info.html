  <h2>General information</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to the online collection of electrical items!
    This website is intended to document and showcase devices used in electrical installations from all over the
    world, both new and old, as well as to describe how they're installed and some of the theoretical aspects behind
    these installations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The general idea behind this site is to document these items in their entirety, showcasing what may not
    be easily found or covered elsewhere - for example, by photographing them from different angles to show exactly
    how they're constructed.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the site covers items from many different countries, most of them are from Italy, as that's where I live.
    Electrical installations in Italy have a number of significant differences from ones found in most of Europe;
    here's a brief overview of their most unique features:
  </p>

  <h4>Types of plugs</h4>
  <p><img src="images/general_info/plugs_compared.jpg" height="130" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    Unlike other countries, which generally only have one type of plug, or at most two for earthed and non-earthed
    devices, Italy has <b>four</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ones on the left are the original Italian plugs - there are two of them, a 10 and a 16A version, since they
    were originally intended for <a href="history.html">two different voltages</a> (generally 120 and 220V) at
    different tariffs.
    Plus, there are also the <a href="plugs_schuko.html">Schuko</a> plugs and the <a href="plugs_other.html#europlugs">
    Europlugs</a>, the same as the ones used in the rest of continental Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most sockets found in Italy will accept standard Italian plugs as well as Europlugs, but not Schuko plugs -
    however, most earthed or high-power appliances sold nowadays come with Schuko plugs - very few come with Italian
    ones, generally only laptop chargers and extension cords.
    Because of this, it's common to see these types of adaptors inside most Italian homes:
  </p>
  <a href="images/plugs_ita/adaptor_01.jpg"><img src="images/plugs_ita/adaptor_01.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/plugs_ita/adaptor_02a.jpg"><img src="images/plugs_ita/adaptor_02a.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/plugs_ita/adaptor_02b.jpg"><img src="images/plugs_ita/adaptor_02b.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <p>
    These are Schuko to Italian adaptors - a very common sight for anyone living here, but certainly somewhat unusual
    to anyone else.
  </p>

  <h4>Limited supplies</h4>
  <p>
    The majority of Italian houses only have 3kW (14A) electrical supplies. The <a href="power_meters.html">power meters</a>
    have a built-in limiter breaker, and once you exceed the limit, they trip (specifically, for a 3kW supply that means
    3.3kW continuously or 4kW for a maximum of three hours).
    Suffice to say, these low limits are a problem, as they prevent you from using more than one or two appliances at the
    same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's possible to get a bigger contract, and that's often done on new or recently renovated houses in order to power
    things like air conditioners, but you have to pay more per month, and so most people don't bother or limit themselves
    to a slightly higher upgrade, like 4.5kW.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only reason why these aren't more of a problem than they already are is because the majority of houses still
    use natural gas for heating and cooking - however, given that we're gonna have to switch away from these,
    continuing with these low supplies is quite bad.
  </p>

  <h4>Modularity</h4>
  <p>
    One thing used in Italy that isn't all that common in most of the world is the use of modular <a href="plugs_ita.html">
    electrical accessories</a> - that is, things like power sockets and light switches. This works by having a support
    plate that holds invididual modules, which can be sockets, light switches, buzzers, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a pretty useful system, as it enables for a high degree of flexibility. There are however some disadvantages:
    for one, it tends to make the cost of things higher, as multiple components are needed. Additionally, there isn't a
    single system of modular devices, there are many, and they're entirely incompatible with each other.
