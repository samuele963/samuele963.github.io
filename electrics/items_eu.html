  <h2>European electrical accessories</h2>
  <p>
    This page showcases a few types of electrical items found in Europe. While most Continental European countries
    use fairly similar devices and items, there can still be some differences.<br>
    Note: items used in the UK and Ireland are shown on a <a href="items_uk.html#lightswitch">separate page</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Standard light switch</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a very common style of light switch as found in most of Europe, made by the German manufacturer Busch-Jaeger.
    It's formed of three pieces: the actual switch mechanism itself, a key cover and a faceplate.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key cover - which goes on top of the moving part of the switch assembly - can be swapped out depending on the
    specific need, for example with one with text or an icon, or containing a window for a backlight.
    The faceplate, instead, varies depending on the number of devices, and thus wall box, being used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Disassembly is done by pulling on the front cover with a bit of force; the switch - mountable either with screws
    or "claws", depending on the style of the box - can then be removed, revealing the terminals.
    These are of the screwless type: the wires (which have to be solid core) are installed by pushing them into the
    terminals, and can later be removed using the levers.

  <h3>Surface-mount light switch</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This light switch, made by Austrian manufacturer e2 Elektro, is a surface-mount unit, useful for applications such
    as garages where surface wiring may be more common.
    It's a very clever design, with removable plates on all sides which can be removed and interchanged between solid
    plastic pieces and rubber grommets for inserting a cable. There are also special ones available which allow
    multiple devices to be connected together, for easier mounting and cable routing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The switch mechanism can be removed from the main shell, which makes mounting easier. The terminals are all of the
    screwless variety. The front of the unit contains a small white section - this is a label, which can be easily
    written to by removing the front cover.

  <h3>Appliance connection unit</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 5x2.5mm<sup>2</sup> 400V</i></p>
  <p>
    This device allows the connection of a hard-wired device, such as a stove. It mounts to a standard wall box and
    has a strain relief for the cable, as well as five terminals (for three phases, a neutral and the earth).
  </p>
  <p>
    Devices like these are quite common to connect three-phase stoves in Europe, generally on a 3x16A circuit. In some
    countries specialised plugs are used for this purpose, like the Perilex plugs, while in others connecting appliances
    directly (using something like this) is more common instead.
