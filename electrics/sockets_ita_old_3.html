  <h2>Electrical accessories for round boxes</h2>
  <p>
    The so-called "round box" was the earliest type of wall box in use in Italy, and was common in most of Continental
    Europe, where it's still in use today (with a few improvements).
    Items mounted to round boxes weren't held with any screws; instead, they had sharp metal "arms" on the side which
    then bit onto the sides of the box once the screws were tightnened.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst other European countries improved on this design, adding screws and desiging larger ones that could hold
    multiple devices, these updated wall boxes were never used in Italy, at it instead switched to rectangular ones,
    derived from the <a href="wiring.html#wallboxus">American</a> standard, in the late 60s-70s.
  </p>

  <p><img src="images/sockets_ita_old/illustration_01.jpg" alt="" height=150 style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    Early devices meant for wall boxes were often a more premium alternative to ones that mounted externally to the wall,
    which was at the time much more common, likely because it was easier to retrofit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared to <a href="sockets_ita_old_4.html">later models</a>, whose styling was designed to be visible and look good
    inside a room, these early electrical accessories instead did the opposite, trying their best to be hidden from sight.
    As such, they were often made with a clear (glass, and later plastic) front piece, to be easier to conceal behind
    a wallpaper, with only the bare miniumum being visible.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Early glass power socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: unknown</i></p>
  <p>
    This power socket is an excellent example of how these early ones used to work. It's made of various materials:
    the frame is made of metal, with a ceramic part on the back to hold the contacts. The front cover is glass and
    mouunted using two threaded bakelite rings, which screw onto the contacts of the socket.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, the fact that the front cover is only held by those bakelite pieces, which can be unscreweed by hand, is
    quite dangerous, as once removed the live connections are revealed.

  <h3>BTicino lever light switch</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This light switch shows pretty well how these glass devices used to be installed, as it still has a piece of
    wallpaper present behind the front glass cover plate.
    As with other early light switches of this type, it uses a mechanism similar to <a href="items_american.html">North American</a>
    ones: the switch has a lever that sticks out which is then moved up or down, similarly to switches used in hobby
    electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with the socket shown earlier, installation is done by removing a bakelite ring on the front and removing the
    glass cover plate. The screw terminals are on the back. The device mounts to the wall box using the standard
    mechanism of having metal arms on the side push into the sides of the box.
  </p>

  <h3>Rotary light switch</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: unknown</i></p>
  <p>
    This light switch is similar to the ceramic ones shown <a href="sockets_ita_old_2.html">earlier</a>, since it uses
    a knob that's rotated to turn the lights on or off. However, contrary to some other models, this one can be turned
    in either direction, as the knob itself is held to the device with a screw.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time wall boxes were used, switches of this style had definitely lost some of its popularity, and faded
    away completely after glass electrical accessories fell out of fashion.

  <h3>BTicino glass doorbell</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    Alongside sockets and light switches, devices like doorbells were also available in this style.
    Interestingly, a date code of 1952 is present on it.

  <h3>Glass and bakelite light switch</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    Unlike the other ones this light switch has a large bakelite piece on the front, which is where the screws are.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interestingly, the mechanism and shape of the lever on this one is <b>very</b> similar to American-style light
    switches, even more so than the other ones shown in this page.
  </p>

  <h3>Three phase power socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: likely 15A 380V</i></p>
  <p>
    According to the cardboard piece present on the front, this is a "three phase socket with earth", made by the
    company Saigir from Trieste.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with the other devices shown before, this socket is installed by unscrewing the bakelite rings surrounding the
    contacts and removing the front cover, which in this case is made of acrylic, not glass.
    Wiring is done on the back, with the four terminals for the three phases and the earth connections.
  </p>

  <h3>Double light switch</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This double light switch is mounted similarly to the other ones, although the front cover plate for this one is sadly
    missing. It's not clear who build this one, although the large logos on the back suggest that it was a company from
    Trieste.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with some of the other switches shown in this page, this uses a toggle style switch lever mechanism.
