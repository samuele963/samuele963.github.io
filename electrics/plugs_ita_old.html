  <h2>Old Italian plugs</h2>
  <p>
    This page documents vintage rewireable plugs and connector sockets from Italy, used with appliances and extension
    cords, as well as old types of adaptors to convert between different kinds of plugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    These items have a considerable lack of <a href="safety_ita.html">safety</a> features compared to modern ones:
    most of the ones here lack sleeved pins and the sockets, unless specificed, don't have any sort of
    <a href="safety.html#shutters">shutters</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Standard rewireable plugs and sockets</h3>
  <h4>Round bakelite plug</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: unknown, possibly 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This plug was originally connected to a 1950s tube radio, and presumably was the one that originally came with it.
    Its shape is entirely different from modern Italian plugs, and more akin to the old <a href="plugs_unearthed.html">
    unearthed plugs</a> used in the rest of Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    The body is made out of two pieces of white bakelite. Unusually, the cord entry is on the site.

  <h4>Bakelite plug</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This plug, likely also made in the 50s, is much smaller and shaped more similarly to ones made nowadays.
    It's made out of two identical pieces of brown bakelite, and is then held closed with a screw and a nut.
    This was likely a cost saving measure, to avoid having to make two moulds instead of one.

  <h4>Plugs from MAPL</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V and 15A 380V</i></p>
  <p>
    These are two plugs made by the company MAPL. They're made in a similar way, with a flexible rubber body
    and a hard plastic (or ceramic, for the larger plug) base to hold the pins and screw connections.
    Notably, on both of them a hole is present for a possible earth pin, which isn't there in either of the plugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    To wire them up, the pins are bent sideways to force the base piece out of the rubber body. This can be tricky
    to do, though that's good since it means it'd be difficult for the plug to come apart while in use, and thus
    revealing live connections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interestingly, while the smaller plug has the usual rating of 10A 250V, the larger one is rated for 380V - this
    is quite odd as that style of socket was generally always used for 220V (or, rarely, similar voltages such as
    260V). This rating indicates the possibility of using this with two phases of a 220/380V transformer, a quite
    unusual setup.

  <h4>Rewireable plugs and sockets by BTicino</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 15A and 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a rewireable plug and two sockets made by BTicino. The plug is a non-earthed "large" one, without any
    sleeving (later versions were made that did use sleeved pins.)
    Wiring it up is, unusually, done by untwisting the two pins and removing the front plastic piece.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two plugs, on the other hand, are also quite dangerous since they lack shutters - this also makes it possible
    to connect the earth pin of an appliance to one of the live conductors. The contacts on them are also quite close
    to the surface, which means that, when used with an unsleeved plug, it's possible to leave a considerable amount of
    metal exposed and easy to touch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wiring them is as unusual as with the plug: you have to insert a screwdriver in the holes and remove the contacts
    themselves (which have a thread at the end). The wires are connected by forming a circular shape with them and
    placing them behind the screw thread of the contacts.

  <h4>Round 16A plug</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This round plug, made by OVA, was found at the end of an old extension cord. It's made of a somewhat flexible
    rubbery material and has quite a large shape, being completely round at the front (common on three-phase plugs of
    the time but not as much on single-phase ones), which makes it take up more space compared to standard plug
    designs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The unusual thing about it is that it has a longer earth pin; this is a fairly common feature on other standards
    of plug, to ensure that the earth is always connected first, but it's not at all a thing on Italian plugs.
    It's more common to have the socket use a slightly raised earth contact for essentially the same purpose.

  <h3>Industrial/heavy duty plugs and sockets</h3>
  <p>
    These plugs were the ones present in industrial/heavy duty applications before the advent of the
    <a href="plugs_other.html#industrialiec">IEC 60309</a> ones in use nowadays in most of the 230V world.
  </p>

  <h4>15A three-pin and four-pin plugs</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 15A 380V</i></p>
  <p>
    Although in Italy three-phase power isn't commonly found in the home, it's used on distribution lines and most
    businesses and factories do have all three phases available. So, it makes sense that special plugs would be made
    to connect three-phase equipment, and these are the ones used before the modern IEC ones became commonplace.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first plug, and its matching socket, only has three pins, for the three phases, while the second one also has
    a fourth pin in the centre for the earth connection. Note that, while the first socket has a hole in the middle,
    this is just for the screw holding it together.
    None of the plugs have a neutral connection - as such they could have only been used with balanced loads such as
    motors.
  </p>

  <h4>30A four-pin plug</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 30A 380V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is just a larger version of the plugs shown above, being rated for 30A instead of 15. Its design is identical
    to the other ones, just at a larger scale; additionally, the central earth pin is noticeably smaller than the ones
    for the phases.
  </p>
  <p>
    This particular one has never been used - apart from its immaculate condition, this can be confirmed by the spot
    on the back used for the cord entry not being punched through. It's definitely an interesting way to install a
    plug.
  </p>

  <h4>30A single-phase plug</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 30A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    Special high-current plugs were also available, such as this one. It's made out of a hard plastic material, and has
    large pins for the line and neutral connections as well as the earth.

  <h3>Adaptors</h3>
  <h4>Light socket to power socket adaptor</h4>
  <p>
    These devices were commonly used to connect appliances to lampholders, before power sockets became common in most
    rooms of a house - because of this in Italy they were commonly called <i lang="it">rubacorrente</i> (current stealer).
    Most of them, like this one, had two sockets as well as a pass-through for a lightbulb.

  <h4>16A to 10A socket converter</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: unknown, possibly 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is one of the many styles of adaptors that existed back in the day to convert between the two types of Italian
    plugs. It's quite simple, and converts a (non-earthed) "large" style of socket to be used with 10A plugs.
