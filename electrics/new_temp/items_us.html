    <h3>Standard American light switches</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 125V</i></p>
    <p>
      Traditional American light switches are very distinctive in their shape and operation, rarely found
      in other parts of the world. The switch has a small lever that protrudes outwards and is moved up or
      down to turn the lights on or off, similarly to toggle switches used in hobby electronics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The examples shown here are both made by Leviton; one is a "two-way" switch, while the other is a
      "three-way" one, for controlling a light from multiple locations. The latter is also compatible with
      aluminium wiring, which may be found in old installations and requires special accessories and grease
      to avoid corrosion.
      Both are rated at 15A, as light fixtures tend to be connected on the same circuit as power sockets and
      they're often used to control specific ones in a room powering floor lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Installation is similar to American <a href="plugs_us.html">power outlets</a>: the wire is bent in a
      loop shape and is then placed around the screw, which holds it securely in place after being tightened.
      The faceplate is held on with two screws and is different from the ones used for sockets, with just a
      small rectangular opening.
      It's crucial that this is always properly installed, as when removed the terminals (placed on the side)
      are very easy to touch and can pose a shock hazard.

    <h3>"Decora"-style switch</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 277V</i></p>
    <p>
      In recent years, "Decora" or "paddle" light switches have become popular and are nowadays ubiquitous in
      new or renovated installations. Their main feature is very large surface area that looks modern and is
      easier to press compared to traditional switches.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style originated in the Decora series from Leviton, designed to have a clean and modern look and
      has now become a de-facto standard. Decora accessories, as well as ones from other manufacturers, all
      use the same rectangular faceplate, helping with intercompatibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to the switch shown previously, the terminals are identical, though this one also has a quick
      wiring feature. Touching the terminals with the faceplate removed is still possible, but much harder.
      Interestingly, this model is rated for 277V circuits, often used for lighting on industrial or
      commercial installations using a 480V supply.
    </p>

    <h3>Leviton Decora Edge light switch</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 277V</i></p>
    <p>
      The new Decora Edge series from Leviton introduces some important safety and convenience elements to
      North American electrical accessories. The main change is in the screwless terminals, which function
      similarly to Wago wire connectors. Wiring is done simply by opening the lever next to each terminal,
      pushing the wire in, and then closing the lever again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another difference is in the frame, made of both plastic and metal, which is much larger and has
      small protrusions to link to other Decora Edge items when used in bigger wall boxes.
      The absence of any easily accessible live parts, as well as the larger frame, makes it virtually
      impossible to receive an electric shock when the faceplate is removed, and quite difficult even when
      the switch isn't screwed in.
    </p>

    <h3>Combined light switch and power socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 125V</i></p>
    <p>
      Combining a light switch with a power outlet may seem strange at first, but it makes sense in situations
      where a larger wall box isn't available, or if another socket is desperately needed.
      The switch is marked with "ON" and "OFF" and has a small indicator light underneath, useful if the
      connected fixture isn't easily visible, like the ones for a closet or outside the house.
      The socket is marked with "<a href="plugs_us.html#tr">TR</a>" (tamper-resistant) as it features
      <a href="safety.html#shutters">safety shutters</a>, mandatory on new installations in the US.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that this is different from <a href="plugs_uk.html">UK</a>-style switched sockets,
      as the switch is clearly intended just to control a light; there's even a built-in link between the
      input side of the switch and the line terminal of the outlet.
      Wiring it to control the socket is possible, but it'd require removing this link and adding a jumper
      lead between its output connection and the aforementioned line terminal.
