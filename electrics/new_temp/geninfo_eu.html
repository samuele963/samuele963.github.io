    <h2>An introduction to European electrics</h2>
    <p>
      The electrical system in Europe can be varied, as different countries adopted different rules over the past century. However, over time
      most countries have standardised on electrical pracices derived from the German electrical system.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page documents, specifically, the electrical standards adopted by these countries. A separate page is available for the practices
      adopted by <a href="">Italy</a>, as its electrical system has some significant differences.
    </p>

    <h3 id="plugs">Plugs</h3>
    <p>
      Three types of plug are commonly found on European appliances. By far the most common is the CEE 7/16 <a href="europlugs.html">Europlug</a>,
      a small non-earthed plug used with low-powered devices such as phone chargers, desk lamps and TVs. This plug is compatible with all
      sockets in continental Europe; its main limit is the lack of earthing and maximum rating of 2.5A.
    </p>
    <p>
      For earthed appliances, CEE 7/7 plugs are used. They are compatible with both Schuko and French-style sockets and have a rating of
      16A. Rewireable versions exist, though it's common to instead use CEE 7/4 (Schuko-only) and 7/6 (French-only) plugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, CEE 7/17 plugs are often found on high-power non-earthed devices, such as hairdryers and space heaters; they can be
      regarded as the non-earthed version of CEE 7/7.
      These plugs are almost always only seen moulded on cords. Rewireable versions exist but aren't allowed in some countries and in general are
      very uncommon.
    </p>

    <h3 id="sockets">Power sockets</h3>
    <div class="infobar paragraph">More info on this topic: <a href="plugs_schuko.html">Schuko plugs and sockets</a></div>
    <p>
      CEE 7/3 "Schuko" sockets are by far the most common type of power socket in use in Europe. These are earthed sockets; the earth
      connection is provided by two tabs on the side of a deep recess, which makes it impossible to touch the pins of the plug while they're
      live. Schuko sockets aren't polarised, which means that plugs can be inserted in either direction, without distinction between line
      and neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five countries in Europe <a href="plugs_french.html">French-style</a> (CEE 7/5) sockets are used; these have an earth pin protruding
      from the front and are polarised, though the polarisation isn't well-enforced. On these sockets, safety shutters are always present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normal <a href="wall_boxes.html#eu">wall boxes</a> are cabable of fitting a single socket, though there are also double sockets available.
      These stick out from the wall lightly more than a standard outlet, but are very convenient and avoid the difficulty of replacing the
      entire box with a larger one. Surface-mount power sockets are also available and tend to be used in garages and industrial installations,
      where surface-mount cables or conduit may be preferrable.
    </p>

    <a href="files/images/general_info/eu_06.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/general_info/eu_06.jpg" class="image three" alt="Surface-mount socket with light switch."></a>

    <h3 id="lightswitches">Light switches and other accessories</h3>
    <div class="infobar paragraph">More info on this topic: <a href="items_eu.html">European electrical accessories</a></div>
    <p>
      Light switches have a large surface, which is pushed up or down to toggle the lights on or off. Double switches are available and commonly
      used, housing two light switches in a single device.
      In some instances, pushbutton-style switches are used alongside a relay, which can be useful for controlling a light from different
      locations without complex wiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electrical accessories are generally non-modular, comprised of a single block which a faceplate is then attached to. In a larger style
      of wall box, multiple devices are installed, with a single faceplate that clips on all of the devices. Wall boxes tend to be installed
      either horizontally or vertically, so it's common for faceplates to support devices facing either orientation.
    </p>

    <h3 id="breakers">Breaker and fuse boxes</h3>
    <!--<div class="infobar paragraph">More info on this topic: <a href="breakers_eu.html">European breaker boxes</a></div>-->
    <p>
      Breaker panels are generally fairly standard across Europe, with few differences. Everything is modular; the enclosures used - typically
      made of plastic - have a special type of metal rail inside, called a DIN rail. This is a standard widespread throughout the world and
      enables the use of different types of devices inside a panel aside from just breakers, for example power sockets, surge protection devices
      and doorbell transformers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power supply typically comes into some sort of main switch - this could be a breaker, but is more commonly an isolator switch, a
      single main <a href="safety.html#rcd">RCD</a> (though newer installations tend to use multiple RCDs), or <a href="fuses_eu.html#neozed">
      Neozed</a> fuses.
      Power is then fed to the breakers; nowadays, it is common to do so via a busbar - a piece of copper (covered by plastic, for protection)
      providing a power source to multiple breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old installations tend to use fuses, typically of the <a href="fuses_eu.html#diazed">Diazed</a> type, which was common in many European
      countries. These fuses are shaped like a bottle and fit inside a ceramic cap, which screws into an Edison socket.
      The design of the fuse and fuse holder is such that it's impossible to use a higher amperage of fuse than the circuit allows.
    </p>
