    <h2>BTicino "Magic" safety plugs and sockets</h2>
    <p>
      In the 60s, the standard of <a href="plugs_ita_old.html">plugs</a> and <a href="sockets_ita_old.html">sockets</a> used in Italy at the
      time was considerably dangerous: plugs didn't have sleeved pins, which made it easy to accidentally receive a shock, and the sockets
      didn't have any sort of safety shutters.<br>
      Due to this, there was an increasing dissatisfaction with the current system, and the Italian company BTicino  - the most popular
      manufacturer of electrical devices at the time - tried to design a replacement which would fix those issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the "<i lang="it">prese e spine di sicurezza</i>" - safety plugs and sockets - were created. More commonly, however, they were
      known as the <b>Magic</b> plugs, as they were created as part of the very popular <a href="sockets_ita_old_5.html">modular system</a>,
      with each socket bearing the word "MAGIC" on the front cover.
    </p>

    <p>
      This standard was extremely safe for the time and in fact is, arguably, even more safe than any other one used nowadays.
      The plugs were polarised, and designed in such a way that made it impossible to touch any live contacts, while the sockets had a
      special type of shutter system which was extremely difficult to defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Magic plugs were a failure - no appliances were sold with them, thus requiring the user to rewire them. Adaptors were also
      available, but obviously defeated the safety measures. Additionally, their higher price limited their adoption to higher-end
      installations.
      Over time, standard Italian plugs and sockets also adopted some of these safety features, such as
      <a href="safety.html#shutters">shutters</a> and <a href="safety.html#sleeved_pins">sleeved pins</a>, which negated the benefits of
      using the Magic plugs even further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, all of these factors lead to the failure of the Magic standard to reach mass adoption, though it was moderately successful
      for a number of years as a specialised connector, owing to the fact that it was polarised and incompatible with normal plugs. The 10A
      version is still available and commonly used for these purposes in Chile, often being found on dedicated circuits for IT and electronic
      equipment.

    <h3>10A plug and socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      Of the four different types of Magic plugs and sockets released, the 10A ones were by far the most popular.
      As previously mentioned, these plugs were very safe: instead of having conventional pins like in every other standard, they used a
      plastic piece with contacts on the side, which couldn't be touched while energised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The socket had a single shutter on the front with a very peculiar mechanism, which made it impossible to insert anything other than
      a matching plug, thus preventing electric shocks.

    <h3>16A Magic socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      16A power sockets were also available - this one was placed inside a special enclosure made for use with extension cords, which could
      work with other types of modules, including conventional Italian outlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to 10A ones, 16A plugs and sockets have some special notches and matching indentations on them: as expected, one of them
      prevents the use of 16A plugs in 10A sockets. The second one, however, is more strange, as it does the reverse - stopping <b>10A</b>
      plugs from working in 16A power sockets.<br>
      While this may seem unusual, this is exactly the same behaviour as in standard Italian plugs of the time. Later 10A Magic plugs
      changed this, and had an extra indentation to fit in 16A sockets.
