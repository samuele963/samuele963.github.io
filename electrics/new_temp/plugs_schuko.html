    <h2>Schuko plugs and sockets</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Busch-Jaeger Schuko sockets</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      These are two common types of Schuko sockets, made by German manufactuer Busch-Jaeger. Both are single
      sockets, though they can be joined with other devices by using a different faceplate. They're mounted to
      a standard European <a href="wall_boxes.html#eu">wall box</a>, either using screws or, in older
      installations, metal arms ("claws") that push outwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      After removing a screw on the front, the cover plate can be taken off, revealing the wire connections.
      These are of the screwless type: the wires, which have to be solid core, are installed just by pushing
      them into the terminals. They can later be removed by pushing on a plastic lever, which is designed to
      also cover the live parts of the socket for safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second socket is constructed basically identically to the first one, just with a more modern-looking
      faceplate - and <a href="safety.html#shutters">safety shutters</a>. Shutters aren't mandatory in Germany
      (and countries that adopted similar electrical standards), however they are a requirement in Denmark,
      Italy and Norway.
    </p>

    <h3>Standard Schuko plugs</h3>
    <p>
      Most earthed appliances come fitted with a moulded-on CEE 7/7 plug, compatible both with Schuko and
      <a href="plugs_french.html">French-style</a> sockets. CEE 7/4 plugs, which look similar but lack the hole
      for the earth pin on French sockets and thus can only fit in Schuko ones, are nowadays only found in
      the form of rewireable plugs sold in hardware stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both moulded-on and rewireable plugs (but especially the former) are available in versions with the cord
      coming out of the side; these tend to look better and are easier to conceal behind furniture, but have the
      disadvantage of being harder to remove. As such, they're usually found on items that tend to be plugged in
      most of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, there's a third style of plug, the CEE 7/17 "contour plug". These are similar to CEE 7/7
      ones, but lack an earth connection. They're found on high-power appliances that don't need to be earthed,
      such as hairdryers and space heaters. For low-power devices, <a href="europlugs.html">Europlugs</a> are
      very frequently used.
    </p>

    <h3>Dual Schuko socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      Dual outlets are a useful way to get two power sockets in a single wall box, which can otherwise only fit
      one. This is done quite cleverly, by placing the contacts within the area of the wall box; this way, the
      front cover only has to protrude by a small amount, to fit the recess needed by Schuko sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      This partiular example has been built by Legrand as part of the Nilo√® series and is built entirely out
      of plastic, making it feel a bit cheaper. Wire connections are done with classic screw terminals.
      Interestingly, the front cover is held both with screws and by being clipped on.
    </p>

    <h3>Rewireable plug from Legrand</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This is an example of a rewireable Schuko plug, specifically of the CEE 7/4 type. Wiring it up is simple:
      after removing one screw, the casing is opened; the wires are screwed into the terminals and the cord is
      then secured using the built-in strain relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rewireable plugs are handy for building or fixing an extension cord or power strip, repairing an appliance,
      or, when using higher-end plugs, to improve the look of an installation.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/plug_04a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/plug_04a.jpg" class="image three" alt="Front view of the plug. It's made of white plastic with brass-coloured pins."></a>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/plug_04b.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/plug_04b.jpg" class="image three" alt="Internals of the plug, with the wire terminals and strain relief."></a>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/plug_04c.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/plug_04c.jpg" class="image three" alt="Plug inserted into a socket."></a>

    <h3>Plug with side-entry cord</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      While not very common, there are also rewireable plugs available with a side entry cord. These are
      especially useful to hide behind furniture, but also just for aesthetic reasons, since having the wire
      closer to the wall tends to look better.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/plug_05a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/plug_05a.jpg" class="image three" alt="View of the plug. The hole for the power cord is placed on the side."></a>

    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/plug_05c.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/plug_05c.jpg" class="image three" alt="Plug with a cord installed."></a>

    <h3>Connector socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This is a connector socket, used to build extension cords. Like many of the sockets shown here, it doesn't
      have safety shutters. Taking it apart is done by removing a screw and sliding the internals out of the
      outer plastic shell.
    </p>

    <h3>Plug with switch</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This rewireable plug has the interesting feature of having a built-in double-pole switch. This might be
      useful in situations where the appliance might not have a power switch, or if it's in a spot that's hard
      to reach.
      The use of a double-pole switch makes sense, as it ensures that the appliance is entirely isolated from
      the supply once the switch has been set to the off position.
    </p>

    <h3>Surface-mount IP44 socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      Surface-mount sockets like this one tend to be found in places like garages or workshops, where surface
      wiring tends to be more frequently used due to its flexibility and ease of installation. This specific
      example is IP44 rated, which means it can resist light splashes. Because of this, a spring-loaded lid is
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two removable rubber grommets are present on the top and bottom, which can be punched through to fit a
      cable or conduit. The wire terminals are of the older style with screws.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_01a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_01a.jpg" class="image three" alt="Front view of the socket, with the lid open. The socket is made of light grey plastic, with a dark grey lid."></a>

    <h3>Surface-mount Busch-Jaeger socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This small surface-mount socket is more suitable for use inside the home; it's built very well, as is
      typical of this manufacturer. The outer casing is made out of a single piece of plastic, which then
      screws onto another piece which holds the contacts; the latter is also where the holes for the mounting
      screws are placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unusually, the terminals aren't of the screwless type; this is to be expected on cheaper sockets like the
      one shown previously, but it's a bit strange to see on a new Busch-Jaeger item.
    </p>

    <h3>Triple socket by Kopp</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This surface socket is interesting primarily due to its unusual triangular shape. Unfortunately, after a
      quick look, its build quality is rather disappointing. The casing is rather flimsy, and the contacts
      are unreliable, with one of them being loose right from the factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This problem is caused by the contacts not having any way to be pushed back together after a plug is
      removed, which can make them loosen over time. Better sockets have an additional piece of metal next to
      each contact, which acts as a spring and prevents such an issue from occurring.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_03a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_03a.jpg" class="image three" alt="Front view of the socket. It has three outlets, arranged in a triangular shape."></a>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_03b.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_03b.jpg" class="image three" alt="Rear view of the socket."></a>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_03c.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_03c.jpg" class="image three" alt="View of the interior of the socket, with its unreliable contacts."></a>

    <h3>Socket with built-in light switch</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      When using surface wiring, it's natural that items like this one may be needed: it's a simple Schuko
      socket combined with a <a href="items_eu.html">light switch</a>. This model is a particularly cheap one,
      though there are higher-end versions too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line terminal of the socket and switch are often joined together (and in some other items this is
      already done at the factory), so that the light may be powered from the same circuit as the socket. This
      also means that only a 4-core cable has to be used.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_04a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/surface_socket_04a.jpg" class="image three" alt="Front view of the socket. A light switch is present on the top."></a>

    <h3>Vintage Schuko plug</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This is a vintage Schuko plug, made by Presto and built out of brown bakelite. Unlike certain other plug
      standards around the world, there hasn't been a substantial redesign of Schuko plugs over time, so there
      isn't much that sets this plug apart from ones used nowadays.
      However, there are still some defining features to point out: the lower rating of 10A was common in the
      early days of Schuko, and the pointy pins are quite unusual.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/plug_07a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/plug_07a.jpg" class="image three" alt="Side view of the plug. It's made of brown bakelite and has pointy pins."></a>

    <h3 id="ddrplug">East German plug and connector socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V (socket), 16A AC / 10A DC (plug)</i></p>
    <p>
      Electrical items made in East Germany are always fascinating; in particular, this is a plug and mactching
      connector socket built in the GDR.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tell-tale sign that these items were manufactured there is the presence of the "quality marks"
      <sup>[<a href="https://plugsocketmuseum.nl/Europlug3.html#QualityMarks">more info</a>]</sup> moulded onto
      the plastic casing, which indicated if the product was suitable for export or only for use inside the
      country. Both of these have a rating of "1", which indicates a high quality product.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/plug_08a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/plug_08a.jpg" class="image three" alt="Front view of the plug. It's made out of a creamy beige bakelite, with a brown piece on the front where the pins are."></a>

    <p>
      A somewhat interesting feature of the connector socket is the strain relief, which is a metal piece that
      also acts as the wire terminal for the earth connection. It's connected to the earthing clips at the
      front using a rivet and a solder joint, which have loosened over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Multiway adaptors</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      These are two examples of Schuko multiway adaptors, used to connect multiple devices at the same time. The
      first one, given the size of Schuko outets, is quite large, with three sockets arranged in a "T" shape.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_schuko/adaptor_01a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_schuko/adaptor_01a.jpg" class="image three" alt="Side view of the adaptor. One Schuko socket is visile, the other two are on the top and bottom."></a>

    <p>
      The second adaptor is smaller than the previous one, as it only has a single Schuko socket and two
      (much more compact) ones meant for <a href="europlugs.html">Europlugs</a>. It also features an illuminated
      switch to turn the power off, almost like a mini power strip.
