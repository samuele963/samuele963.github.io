    <h2>Other types of plugs and sockets</h2>
    <p>
      This page covers some different types of plugs and sockets meant for mains power, not present in the other sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: connectors meant for antennas or SELV (safety extra-low voltage) use are showcased in a <a href="other_items.html">separate</a>

    <h3 id="french_2pin">French 6A non-earthed plugs</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      These unusual two-pin, non-earthed plugs are available in France for rewiring appliances. While they may initially look very similar
      to the <a href="europlugs.html">Europlugs</a>, just rated for 6A instead of 2.5A, there is a significant physical difference: the body
      of the plug is wider, which prevents it from fitting in <a href="plugs_schuko.html">Schuko</a> and <a href="plugs_swiss.html">Swiss</a>
      power sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plugs of this type seem to be a standard in France: matching sockets can be found on certain multiway adaptors, power strips and
      connector sockets. It's unclear why the physical incompatibility with other types of socket is present; rewireable plugs rated at 6A
      with the same shape as Europlugs do exist, don't suffer from the same limitations and some even have French certification markings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the plug, there is also a matching socket, both made by the same company. The socket works with Europlugs, two-pin
      6A French plugs and non-earthed 10A <a href="plugs_ita.html">Italian</a> ones. Unsurprisingly, the plug was bought at a hardware store
      in France - however the socket was obtained separately, at a hardware store in Slovenia, sold alongside rewireable Europlugs.
      Evidently the usefulness of the socket has made them attractive enough to be sold in other countries as well, likely to build or
      repair non-earthed extension cords.

    <h3 id="lampsocket">French light fixture plugs (DCL)</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      DCL (<i lang="fr">dispositif de connexion luminaires</i>, device for connection of luminaires) plugs are special types of plugs
      and sockets for connecting ceiling light fixtures, replacing traditional hard-wired installations using terminal blocks.
      Their use is now mandatory in France and Norway for new or renovated houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sockets have flat contacts, underneath a deep recess which hides the plug completely. They're also polarised and earthed.
      A hook is present to support the weight of the fixture; when installed properly, using a special type of wall box, it's possible to
      use lamps with a weight of up to 25kg, as also indicated on the socket.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_other/dcl_01a.jpg"><img src="files/images/plugs_other/dcl_01a.jpg" class="image three" alt="DCL socket, with plug inserted. A hook is present to hang the light fixture. The plug is sitting flush with the socket."></a>

    <a href="files/images/plugs_other/dcl_01c.jpg"><img src="files/images/plugs_other/dcl_01c.jpg" class="image three" alt="DCL socket taken out of the special wall box."></a>
    <p>
      DCL plugs are very small, as they're meant to not stick out from the ceiling after being plugged in. They have three very small
      flat pins, with a length of just 7mm, as well as a retaining clip which holds the plug in the socket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adaptors with a standard Edison lamp socket are available. These allow the electrical installation to be tested, and the room to be
      lit, before the house is fully furnished.
      Later on, the adaptor can be removed and replaced with a more pleasant-looking fixture; for this purpose, it is supplied from the
      factory with a DCL plug clipped to the side.

    <h3 id="israeli">Israeli plugs and sockets</h3>
    <p>
      The SI32 (type H) plug standard is quite unique, being used only in Israel and the Gaza Strip.
      This standard has had a significant evolution over the years; old plugs and sockets used flat pins, in a Y configuration, and were
      initially rated at 10A. Later on, the standard was "upgraded" to 16A, but without any change in design of the plugs. This, reportedly,
      led to overheating when high-power appliances were used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="files/images/plugs_other/israel_01d.jpg"><img src="files/images/plugs_other/israel_01d.jpg" class="imageright" height="130" alt="CEE 7/7 Schuko plug inside an Israeli socket. The earth contacts on the side of the plug aren't connected in any way."></a>
      To solve this problem new plugs were introduced, using round pins with a diameter of 4.5mm. Revised sockets, introduced in 1989,
      have both flat and round holes, in order to accept both old and new plugs as well as <a href="europlugs.html">Europlugs</a>, which
      are quite common.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newest style of sockets have wider round holes so as to also accept earthed CEE 7/7 (Schuko) plugs, but without providing an earth
      connection. Aside from the earth hole, these sockets are very similar in style to the old European
      <a href="plugs_unearthed.html">non-earthed</a> ones.
    </p>

    <h4>Earthed power socket</h4>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This is a newer style of socket, with the wider holes mentioned previously. It's built similarly to European-style ones and uses the
      same style of mounting, though unusually the frame is made of plastic rather than metal - likely because this is a very cheap model.
      Markings are present on the frame to indicate polarisation: line is on the right and neutral is on the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety is quite lacking with this socket: it doesn't feature any sort of <a href="safety.html#shutters">safety shutters</a> and
      only has a very shallow (around 1-2mm) recess.
      This makes it possible to accidentally touch the plug pins, which are rarely ever sleeved, and thus receive an electric shock.
    </p>

    <h4>Two-way adaptors</h4>
    <p><i>Rating: max 3500W, 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      Multiway adaptors can be essential in older houses with few power sockets; these are two inexpensive examples of two-way ones,
      allowing for connection of two appliances.
      They're very similar to each other; the main differences between the two is that one has the plug rotated by 90Â°, as well as a
      slight angle to the sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them have sleeved pins or safety shutters; however, both have a slight protrusion on the plug, in order to fit in sockets
      with a shallow recess like the one shown previously.
