    <h2>Modern Italian plugs and sockets</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="files/images/plugs_ita/plugs_overview.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_ita/plugs_overview.jpg" class="imageright" height="166" alt="An overview of the different types of plug used in Italy: from left to right, a CEE 7/7 Schuko plug, a CEE 7/17 Europlug, an earthed 10A plug and a 16A plug."></a>
      Italian plugs and sockets differ significantly from the ones seen in the rest of continental Europe.
      Traditionally, Italy has used the "type L" standard, consisting of two plug sizes (10A and 16A) differing
      in pin diameter and spacing and with a central earth pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these plugs are still available, few appliances are still sold with them nowadays, as they've been
      mostly relegated to power strips, extension cords and laptop chargers; instead, the
      <a href="plugs_schuko.html">Schuko</a> standard used in other countries in Europe is now ubiquitous.
      However, the vast majority of household sockets aren't compatible with them, leading many to rely on
      <a href="#adaptors">adaptors</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with the plugs, Italian sockets are available in two sizes, 10A and 16A. These days the latter
      are most common and tend to be of the "<span lang="it">Bipasso</span>" type, which means they accept
      either size of plug.
      This wasn't the case originally, as the two plug sizes were initially meant for different power tariffs
      and thus purposefully incompatible. These <a href="temp/sockets_ita_old.html">older</a> sockets are quite
      uncommon nowadays, but may still be found in older installations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- need to add a link to the items_ita page in the future -->
      Italian sockets (and electrical accessories in general) are entirely modular,
      with different types of modules that can be connected together to form various combinations of layouts.
      This particular one is from BTicino as part of their Matix series.

    <h3>Italianised Schuko power sockets</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      As Schuko plugs have been present on appliances for decades, adapted sockets compatible with them are
      becoming more popular, especially in new installations. Three different types are available in Italy;
      CEI 23-50 P40, the most common version by far, allows both sizes of traditional Italian plugs to fit as
      well as Schuko ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most obvious difference compared to conventional <a href="plugs_schuko.html">Schuko</a> outlets is
      in the openings for the pins, which resemble the "figure of eight"-shaped slots on
      <span lang="it">Bipasso</span> sockets, but are larger to allow for the thicker (4.8mm) pins of Schuko
      plugs.
      Additionally, as 16A plugs tend to be wider, the recess is bigger and often also shallower, as certain
      types of adaptors wouldn't be able to be inserted otherwise - though it is still deep enogh to protect
      against accidental shocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their adoption has been quite slow until recently, and <span lang="it">Bipasso</span> sockets are still
      mostly the norm even in new houses. This is due to Schuko sockets being larger - as only one can be
      installed in a standard Italian 3-module <a href="wall_boxes.html#ita">wall box</a> - and more expensive,
      as well as a lack of any regulation mandating them.
    </p>

    <h3>Standard Italian plugs</h3>
    <p>
      These are some example of type L plugs, commonly used in Italy. There are two types, one is rated at 10A
      and has pins with a diameter of 4.0mm spaced 19mm apart, while the other is rated at 16A and has 4.8mm
      pins with a spacing of 22mm.
      This difference is there for a reason: originally, the smaller plugs were meant for lighting while the
      larger ones were for appliances, and were on different rates and voltages. More info about this is
      available in the <a href="articles/history.html">history page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While nowadays they've mostly been relegated to power strips and extension cords, these plugs are still
      the most common for manually wiring an appliance, as they're compatible with the vast majority of
      sockets. This is also why they're the default on adaptors and power strips, though the latter typically
      have Schuko-compatible sockets.

    <h3>BTicino "Corner" 10A plug</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This is one of the many styles of plug available in Italy. It's a "Corner" model made by BTicino, and as
      the name implies its main feature is that the pins can be set up in one of two positions, on the front
      or on the side.
      Having the pins on the side makes this plug take up very little space (only 14mm!), which can be useful
      for sockets placed behind furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main problem with this design is that neither of its two position are compatible with a Schuko-style
      socket. As these are becoming increasingly common, this may cause issues when using appliances fitted
      with this style of plug.
    </p>

    <h3 id="adaptors">Schuko to Italian adaptors</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 1500W 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      As previously mentioned, it's common for appliances sold in Italy to be fitted with Schuko plugs even
      though most sockets aren't compatible with them. This has lead to the proliferation of adaptors: simple
      plastic devices with a Schuko socket at one end and an Italian plug at the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that, by law, all adaptors (of any type) have to have a maximum rating of 1500W, though their
      actual physical rating is likely more than that, and they're frequently used for higher loads such as
      hairdryers and washing machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the idea of using adaptors on a regular basis may seem dangerous - and, to be fair, they do
      introduce an additional point of failure - keep in mind that these are purpose-built devices that are
      nothing like the <a href="travel_adaptors.html">travel adaptors</a> used on holidays.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_ita/adaptor_01.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_ita/adaptor_01.jpg" class="image three" alt=""></a>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_ita/adaptor_02a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_ita/adaptor_02a.jpg" class="image three" alt=""></a>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_ita/adaptor_02b.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_ita/adaptor_02b.jpg" class="image three" alt=""></a>
    <p>
      Adaptors that do the opposite, that is, allow an Italian plug to be used with a Schuko socket, are also
      available though obviously not as popular. They still have their uses though, especially for people
      travelling or living in border regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both styles are available either as stand-alone or multi-way adaptors; the latter, which allow the
      connection of multiple appliances, typically have two <span lang="it">Bipasso</span> sockets and one
      Schuko one.
