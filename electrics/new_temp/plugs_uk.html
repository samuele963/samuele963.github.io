    <h2>British plugs and sockets</h2>
    <p>
      The British standard of plugs and sockets (BS 1363) is one of the safest ones in the world, having been
      designed in the 1940s with safety in mind and improved throughout the years.
      UK plugs have three rectangular pins, which since the 80s have to be sleeved to prevent anyone from
      coming in contact with them while they're live. They also have a built-in fuse (a unique feature) to
      protect the power cord of the appliance, necessary due to the 32A
      <a href="radial_ring.html#ring">ring circuits</a> often found in British homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety <a href="safety.html#shutters">shutters</a> have been present since the beginning, being one of
      the first countries to make them mandatory. These operate by having the earth pin - which is slightly
      longer - push down a plastic flap which normally covers up the line and neutral contacts. Because of
      this, an earth pin is mandatory, even on non-earthed appliances; these often have plugs with plastic
      earth pins, called ISODs (Insulated Shutter Opening Device) instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the UK, BS 1363 plugs have also been adopted in Ireland, Cyprus, Hong Kong, Malta and
      Saudi Arabia.

    <h3>Standard double power socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 13A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      Double-gang (or "twin") sockets, like the one shown here, are the most common type used in the UK and
      Ireland. A power switch is present for each outlet to cut power to it; while this is a popular feature,
      it's not an actual requirement, unlike in Australia or New Zealand. As this is a cheap model, the switch
      is single-pole, but on higher-end devices they tend to be double-pole to properly isolate the connected
      appliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The socket is a single-block item and so is mounted to the <a href="wall_boxes.html#uk">wall box</a>
      using two screws visible from the front; small plastic covers are then placed on top in order to hide
      them.
      Wiring is done with screw terminals, which support both solid core and stranded wires. Screwless
      terminals are now available in the UK, though they're not yet common.

    <h3>Single-gang socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 13A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This is a single power socket. Single-gang boxes tend to be used for light switches, but they are
      occasionally installed for outlets as well. Unlike the one shown previously, this particular example
      doesn't have a power switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      One interesting feature present in all of these sockets is a metal bar connecting the earth terminal to
      one (or both) of the mounting screws. This is because metal wall boxes are quite common in the UK, and
      require being earthed for safety.

    <h3>Shaver adaptor</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 1A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      While the BS 1363 plug is the only type used domestically in the UK and Ireland, there is an exception:
      shavers. These use special 2-pin plugs designed for this purpose (BS 4573, an adaptation of the old
      non-earthed BS 372 standard) or <a href="europlugs.html">Europlugs</a>, meant to connect to a shaver
      socket inside a bathroom. However, ordinary British sockets aren't compatible with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This adaptor solves this problem, by safely allowing the connection of a BS 4573 plug, Europlug, or US
      two-pin non-polarised plug to a BS 1363 socket. To prevent them from being misused, strict safety
      regulations regulate the design of shaver adaptors: as such, they must be fitted with safety shutters
      and a 1A fuse and labelled as being for "shavers only".
