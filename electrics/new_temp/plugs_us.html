    <h3>Standard American power socket</h3>

    <h3>Standard 2- and 3-prong plugs</h3>
    <p>
      North American plugs have two flat blades for line and neutral, as well as a round earth pin, on earthed
      plugs. The non-earthed plugs are known as NEMA 1-15P, and can be either polarised or non-polarised;
      polarisation (that is, being able to distinguish between line and neutral) is achieved by having a
      slightly larger neutral slot, which then only allows the plug to fit in one way. Earthed plugs (NEMA
      5-15P) are always polarised, and thus generally use pins of the same width.

    <h3 id="tr">Tamper-resistant (TR) socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 125V</i></p>
    <p>
      In the last few years, sockets with <a href="safety.html#shutters">safety shutters</a> have become
      mandatory for new and renovated installations. These outlets, which are referred to as "tamper resistant"
      (TR), work and are built the same as normal ones, but they have shutters, which only open when two pins
      of a plug are pushing into them. This helps prevent people from sticking metal objects into a socket and
      receiving an electric shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adoption is at the moment somewhat slow, as these are only really found in newer installations and non-TR
      sockets are still found in the majority of houses, can still often be bought at hardware stores, and
      aren't required (and thus generally never found) on things like power strips and extension cords.
    </p>

    <h3>GFCI-protected outlet</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 125V (20A feed-through)</i></p>
    <p>
      This GFCI-protected power outlet, commonly referred to just as "a GFCI", features built-in protection
      against leakage currents. A <a href="safety.html#rcd">GFCI</a> (or RCD in Europe) protects people from
      shocks by detecting a difference between line and neutral. If this exceeds a certain amount, in this case
      5mA, the device trips and disconnects the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to most European countries, in North America it's generally only common to see this form of
      protection in "wet" areas such as bathrooms and kitchens. Additionally, it's almost always found in the
      sockets themselves, rather than on the breaker panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This device features two outlets (with shutters) for connecting devices, as well as "load" terminals to
      hook up other sockets, which will also be protected. "Test" and "Reset" buttons are present on the front,
      for checking the correct operation of the GFCI and turning the power back on when it has tripped.
    </p>

    <h3>20A power socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 20A 125V</i></p>
    <p>
      NEMA 5-20R outlets are generally found on 20A circuits in commercial applications, for appliances that
      may require more power than an ordinary outlet can provide. Aside from 20A plugs, they also allow the
      use of conventional 15A two- and three-prong ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that, while 20A circuits are common in household installations, 20A sockets generally
      aren't, as the electrical code allows the use of (cheaper) conventional 15A outlets and there are few
      appliances - aside from special use cases - that require them.
    </p>

    <h3>Vintage bakelite plug</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 125V</i></p>
    <p>
      This is an old 2-prong (unearthed) NEMA 1-15P plug, made of two identical piece of bakelite to save cost.
      As common with old plugs of this style, it's not polarised, which means it can be inserted in either
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's interesting to note that this plug was actually made in Italy, though the UL and CSA markings
      indicate that it was clearly meant for the export market.
    </p>

    <h3>Ground defeater adaptors</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 125V</i></p>
    <p>
      These adaptors convert a two-prong (non-earthed) outlet into a three-prong one, with a tab meant to the
      used for the earth connection. In theory, this is supposed to only be used with a 1-15P socket installed
      in a grounded wall box: the tab would connect to the screw holding the faceplate and thus would make it
      possile to connect earthed devices safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in practice, these are almost always just used to bypass the earth connection entirely, in
      houses that lack 3-prong outlets. It's a very well known practice, and it's likely that the official
      purpose of these adaptors is just an excuse to continue to legally sell them.
    </p>

    <h3>Edison lamp socket adaptors</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 125V</i></p>
    <p>
      The adaptors shown here connect to a normal lampholder and convert it to two 2-prong power outlets, to
      plug in standard electrical appliances in situations where an outlet may otherwise not be available. The
      larger ones also feature a pass-through lamp socket for a lightbulb, and the later model also has a
      pull-cord to switch it on or off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devices like these were often used in the early days of electricity all around the world, as it was
      mainly used for lighting back then and thus very few power sockets were generally present in a room.
      However, while in Europe these adaptors haven't been made since the 50s/60s, American equivalents
      continue to be made nowadays, and they're still sometimes used for special applications.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_us/adaptor_02a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_us/adaptor_02a.jpg" class="image three" alt=""></a>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_us/adaptor_02b.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_us/adaptor_02b.jpg" class="image three" alt=""></a>
    <a href="files/images/plugs_us/adaptor_03.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/plugs_us/adaptor_03.jpg" class="image three" alt=""></a>
    <p>
      There are also simpler versions of these adaptors, which only feature one outlet and are thus much smaller.
      Notably, all of these adaptors have a very small power rating (660W), understandable since a lamp socket
      isn't meant to handle a large amount of current, but there's no fuse or breaker to actually enforce this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the older versions of these items are both unpolarised and manufactured respectively by Leviton
      and General Electric.

    <h3>Vintage non-polarised three way adaptor</h3>
    <p>
      This non-earthed, non-polarised adaptor allows the use of three devices on a single socket. Unpolarised
      outlets such as on this device are now largely useless due to the proliferation of polarised appliances,
      however it could still be useful for things like phone chargers.
    </p>

    <h3>Old multi-outlets with three sockets</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 15A 125V</i></p>
    <p>
      These are two vintage connector sockets built by Leviton and Eagle, for use at the end of an extension
      cord. Both of them are made of bakelite and have three non-polarised outlets on them, which is definitely
      indicative of their age.
    </p>
    <p>
      A screw on the front is present, which can be removed to reveal the wire connections inside. While
      rewireable ones like these have definitely become uncommon, it's still possible to buy extension cords
      nowadays with something similar to this at the end, though obviously modern ones use polarised outlets
      and have a slightly different look.
