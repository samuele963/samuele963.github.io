    <h2>Modern Italian plugs and sockets</h2>

    <h3>BTicino "Oval" socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      The BTicino Oval series is a series of compact surface-mount electrical accessories, with a distinctive
      oval design. They're especially interesting since they're one of the very few accessories sold in Italy
      nowadays to not be modular.
    </p>
    <p>
      The socket opens toollessly, by unclipping the front cover; two screws are provided for mounting.
      The shell has several spots where holes can be punched out to feed the supply wires; unfortunately, due
      to the small size of the socket, not much space is present on the inside, which may make installation
      harder.
    </p>

    <h3>Multi-way adaptor with switch</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 1500W 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This multi-way adaptor has two 10/16A sockets and one Schuko one, also compatible with 10A plugs. While
      adaptors of this style are quite common, this one is special as it features a power switch.
      Adaptors with switches could be useful for items without a power switch, such as holiday lights.
    </p>

    <h3>Adaptor with built-in thermal fuse</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 1500W 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      As adaptors to convert a 10A socket into a 16A one aren't able to be sold anymore, ones with built-in
      breakers have started being made. This is an example of one, which is quite unusual as it makes use of
      a thermal fuse rather than a breaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      A label on the side indicates that, if the overload protection were to trip, the adaptor is to be
      disconnected for three minutes.

    <h3>Classic Bipasso power strip</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: </i></p>
    <p>
      This is a classic Italian power strip, with four <span lang="it">Bipasso</span> power sockets. Power
      strips of this style have become less common, in favour of ones with Schuko sockets, which can be used
      with more devices without requiring the use of adaptors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite this, they continue to be sold by several brands, as they take up significantly less space than
      one with an equivalent amount of Schuko sockets. This can be a significant advantage, especially when
      only using <a href="europlugs.html">Europlugs</a> or 10A Italian plugs.
