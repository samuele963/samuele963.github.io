    <h2>Radial and ring circuit wiring</h2>
    <p>
      This page covers a wiring distinction specific to the UK. While radial circuits are the type used
      everywhere else in the world, in Britain ring ones are the default, and only recently have they
      started falling out of favour in new installations.
    </p>

    <h3 id="radial">Radial circuits</h3>
    <p>
      Radial circuits are quite simple: the wire connected to a breaker (or fuse holder) is connected to each
      socket, as required. This doesn't have to happen with a continuous cable: junction boxes are used to
      branch off into multiple ones heading in different directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amperage of a radial circuit tends to be 16 (15 in North America) or 20A; as such, multiple
      circuits are required in an installation to reduce the likelyhood of tripping a breaker.
    </p>

    <h3 id="ring">Ring circuits</h3>
    <p>
      As the name suggests, ring circuits use a single loop of wire which connects to each socket and then
      returns back to the breaker. This means that the current can take two paths, thus effectively doubling
      the capacity of a wire (though real-life conditions can affect this, so a safety margin is present);
      a 2.5 mm<sup>2</sup> conductor can thus be used for a 32A circuit, when on a radial circuit a
      4.0 mm<sup>2</sup> one would have to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      As ring circuits always use a 32A breaker (or 30A fuse), some additional precautions have to be taken
      to prevent the cord of an appliance to be overloaded in the case of a fault. Fused plugs are used, while
      hard-wired devices have to be connected to a fused <a href="items_uk.html#connection_unit">connection unit</a>.
      Additionally, adding additional sockets to a circuit is more complex, either requiring extending the ring
      or using a "spur", which is limited to a single outlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their main disadvantage is if the ring is broken at any point - in that case, all the current has to travel
      through a single cable, which can be easily overloaded and risk causing a fire. Because of this, special
      in-depth testing is required when installing or modifying a ring circuit, which isn't necessary on a
      radial one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ring circuits became popular in the UK after World War 2, alongside the introduction of the
      <a href="plugs_uk.html">BS 1363</a> plug standard. During the war, the commission responsible for
      the future reconstruction efforts predicted a possible shortage of copper. The standard up to that
      point was to use 10 or 15A radial circuits, usually with a single fuse for each socket in a building,
      which was quite costly. Comparatively, a single 30A ring circuit could loop around the entire house
      and connect to each socket, saving money.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this made sense at the time, ring circuits are significantly outdated nowadays, and yet continue
      to be legal to install.
