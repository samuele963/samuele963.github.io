    <h2>Europlugs</h2>
    <p>
      Europlugs (formally known as CEE 7/16 Alternative II) are small two-pin non-earthed plugs designed in the
      1960s specifically to be compatible with every kind of socket present in continental Europe. They're rated
      at 2.5A, a result of the flexible pins used to ensure good contact on the different types of socket.
    </p>
    <p>
      These types of plugs are the most common type found in Europe and other parts of the world; they're most
      often used on electronic devices such as power bricks, phone chargers and TVs, either moulded on cords or
      built into the devices themselves. Rewireable versions are also available, though their popularity is
      considerably lower than the moulded-on versions.
    </p>

    <h3>Standard Europlugs</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 2.5A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      These are some standard types of Europlugs, as found on power cords for appliances, phone chargers and
      power bricks. The introduction of this standard has enabled an impressive amount of cross-compatibility,
      reducing the number of country-specific power cords that needed to be produced.

    <h3>Flat rewireable Europlug</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 2.5A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This Europlug is intended to be used in areas with little space, for example with sockets hidden behind
      pieces of furniture. As such, it protrudes very little from a socket, less than a centimetre. A CEE 7/7
      (Schuko-French hybrid plug) version of this is also available from the same manufacturer.
    </p>

    <h3>Rewireable 6A plug</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      Aside from rewireable Europlugs, there are several manufacturers producing Europlug-shaped plugs with a
      higher current rating. This is an example of one - it looks and functions exactly like a normal Europlug,
      but is rated for 6A. Similar plugs can also be found on travel hairdryers, as they require a considerable
      amount of current.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting feature of this specific one is the way it's opened: the outer shell has a hole that the
      head of the screw slots into. Thus, when the screw is tightened, the head isn't in the slot anymore and
      the internals of the plug can slide out.
    </p>

    <h3>Adaptors for 2x and 4x Europlugs</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      These adaptors convert a Schuko, French or non-earthed socket (using a CEE 7/17 plug) into a number of
      Europlugs, useful when plugging in several devices at once. Different styles are available, with 2, 3 or
      4 sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two models are shown here: the first one only has 2 sockets, and has a clever design that allows for
      connection of several adaptors next to each other on a power strip. The second one is larger, with 4
      sockets, and has a power switch.
    </p>

    <h3>TEM Europlug socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      The CEE 7/16 standard doesn't specify any sort of standard for a socket, as the ones already present in
      a country are sufficient. Nevertheless, some companies have produced sockets specifically intended to be
      used with this type of plug.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an example of one of them, made by the Slovenian company TEM as part of their modular "Modul"
      series. It's very clearly derived from a 16A Italian <a href="plugs_ita.html#bipasso">Bipasso</a> socket
      module, including a hole where an earth terminal would have gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might seem strange that anyone would need such a socket, but they can legitimately be useful, for
      example on home theatre setups where a lot of Europlugs have to be plugged in.
    </p>

    <h3>Europlug extension cord</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 2.5A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      Extension cords for Europlugs are also available. This specific one is 5 metres long and uses a
      0.75mm<sup>2</sup> cord.
    </p>
    <a href="files/images/europlugs/extension_cord_01a.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/europlugs/extension_cord_01a.jpg" class="image three" alt="View of the extension cord with the cord coiled up."></a>
    <a href="files/images/europlugs/extension_cord_01b.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/europlugs/extension_cord_01b.jpg" class="image three" alt="Closeup view of the socket part of the extension cord."></a>
    <a href="files/images/europlugs/extension_cord_01c.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/europlugs/extension_cord_01c.jpg" class="image three" alt="Extension cord plugged into a device."></a>

    <h3>Europlug power strip</h3>
    <p>
      This thin power strip was specifically designed to be useful in places where little physical space is available,
      such as behind furniture. It has four Europlug sockets and a CEE 7/17 contour plug instead of a Schuko one, since
      an earth connection isn't needed in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plug has a very strange design, with the cord coming out of the side and a slightly flexible ring to help
      disconnect it from the socket. The side-entry cord makes it possible to use this with a socket hidden behind
      furniture, with very little clearance for the cable.
    </p>

The power strip is made to be very thin, while the plug has the cord coming from the side and a ring to help remove it."></a>
