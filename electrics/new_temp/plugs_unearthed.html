    <h2>European non-earthed plugs and sockets</h2>
    <p>
      Before the advent and popularisation of earthed standards, various types of 2-pin non-earthed plugs and
      sockets were used throughout Europe, which may still be found in older buildings.
      While these plugs varied in shape and size, depending on their age and country of origin, all of them
      used two round pins spaced 19mm apart, which helped with intercompatibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plugs used pins with a diameter of 4.0mm (for a maximum rating of 10A) or, later, 4.8mm (16A), depending
      on their current capability. Sockets accepting both kinds of plug were common in most of Europe, though
      older models may have only accepted 4.0mm plugs, as well as ones in <a href="plugs_ita_old.html">Italy</a>
      and <a href="plugs_swiss.html">Switzerland</a>, as those countries never adopted 4.8mm plugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays, these sockets are known as CEE 7/1, and can still be bought for replacements in some countries.
      Matching plugs with a round base are called CEE 7/2.
      Notably, due to their design, earthed CEE 7/4 (<a href="plugs_schuko.html">Schuko</a>) and 7/6
      (<a href="plugs_french.html">French</a>) plugs can be connected to non-earthed outlets, while CEE 7/2
      plugs cannot be used with either type of earthed socket.
    </p>

    <h3>Standard CEE 7/1 socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This is a modern example of a CEE 7/1 socket. As is common on these types of outlets, it has a very
      shallow recess; this makes it possible to touch the pins of a partially inserted plug, which may be
      live if they're not insulated. Additionally, safety <a href="safety.html#shutters">shutters</a> aren't
      present, though there is a spot inside for where a shutter mechanism would have gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The socket was bought in the Netherlands, one of the few countries where these can still be bought,
      for replacing existing outlets only. Given its purpose, it's quite odd that this model can only be
      mounted using screws and doesn't have the side "claws" needed for old European
      <a href="wall_boxes.html#eu_old">wall boxes</a>, possibly indicating that they may not be as common
      there.

    <h3>Modern CEE 7/2 plug</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      The most distinguishing feature of CEE 7/2 non-earthed plugs is their completely round base, which
      serves two purposes: the first is to prevent someone from touching the live pins, if the socket has a
      deep enough recess; the second is to impede the use of it in an earthed (Schuko or French-style) outlet.
      This questionable design decision was apparently made for safety reasons, though it's unclear what the
      actual danger would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern versions of these plugs, like the one shown here, are still available in some countries, though
      seldom used. There isn't much they could possibly be necessary for nowadays, however, since not being
      able to connect them to earthed sockets is a significant limitation.
    </p>

    <h3>Surface-mount double socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      Surface-mount non-earthed sockets such as this one, with two outlets, are also available. The most
      notable feature of this model is that the recess is much deeper than the one shown earlier, making it
      impossible to touch the live pins of a plug.
    </p>
    <p>
      The holes for mounting it to the wall are on the core of the device, where the contacts and screw
      terminals are located. The top of the plastic case has pre-made indentations, for cutting holes to
      feed wires or conduit.
    </p>

    <h3>French non-earthed socket</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      Non-earthed sockets can also still be bought in France, though they're not all that common. This one
      is part of the high-end Legrand Dooxie series, and is thus designed to look modern and is made of high
      quality materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety shutters are present, a mandatory feature in France, and has a fairly deep recess. The front
      cover can be unclipped to reveal the mounting screws ("claws" are also available as a separate item).
      Wiring is done on the back using screwless (push-in) terminals.
    </p>

    <h3>Vintage German non-earthed plug</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This is a typical example of an old version of these plugs, made out of bakelite. It has split pins,
      to make better contact with sockets used at the time, with a diameter of 4.0mm. This was quite common
      on older plugs, as they were often wired to low-powered devices such as lamps. The thinner pins also
      makes it compatible with outlets that may not have accepted 4.8mm pins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bakelite casing is formed out of a single piece, and thus cannot be opened; the wires are thus
      connected from the front, with the strands being shaped into a circle first and then secured with nuts,
      which screw into the threaded section at the bottom of the pins.
    </p>

    <h3>CEE 7/1 power strip</h3>
    <p><i>Rating: 10-16A 250V</i></p>
    <p>
      This old power strip has three non-earthed sockets, with a small recess and no safety shutters (likely
      due to the age of the device). It can be easily taken apart for wiring, as it's possible that it
      originally came without a power cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oddly enough, this was produced in Italy (and was found at an Italian flea market) even though CEE 7/1
      sockets were never used there. However, given the Dutch and Belgian certification markings on the back,
      this was very likely intended as an export item.
    </p>
