Both are coloured beige. The American socket is taller than the Schuko one, though the width is roughly the same."></a>
    <a href="files/images/image_gallery/us_eu_sockets_02.jpg"><img src="files/images_lowres/image_gallery/us_eu_sockets_02.jpg" class="image three" alt="Rear view of the sockets."></a>
