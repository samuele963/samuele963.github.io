  <h2>Surface-mount electrical accessories</h2>
  <p>
    Surface-mount sockets and light switches - that is, ones meant to screw directly to the wall - were the earliest kinds
    in use in electrical installations. This makes sense, as when electricity was still new every house would have needed
    to be retrofitted, and these are easier to install.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this style of mounting fell out of fashion in favour of wall boxes shortly after WW2, especially as houses
    started being built already with electrical installations in place, they always were and still are available as an
    option.
    Surface-mount devices are more of an eyesore, but in certain cases they make up for it due to their flexibility and
    ease of installation.
  </p>

  <h3>Ceramic power socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This style of power socket was used in the earliest types of electrical installations. The entire device is made of
    ceramic, with connections made on the back and wires (generally rubber or cloth insulated) arriving from the top,
    with two holes for them being present.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with most early sockets, the metal contacts here are hollow tubes, which apply no pressure to the plug. Very early
    plugs had solid pins that had to match perfectly to the socket, though soon after plugs with split pins were introduced,
    and were in use for many decades.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this, most modern plugs don't fit well into this socket, and very little force is necessary to pull them out.

  <h3>Ceramic light switch</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    The light switch shown here is a good example of a very common style of mechanism in use for early light switches:
    instead of having some sort of lever as a control, they instead use a rotating knob, which is turned in a clockwise
    direction to turn the lights on or off.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this is also found in later light switches made of bakelite, this style is mainly found on ceramic ones.
    The front of this one is, oddly, made of metal, with an insulating coating on the back to prevent it from becoming
    live.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taking it apart is done toolessly, by rotating the knob in a counter-clockwise direction in order to unscrew it, and
    it's the only thing keeping the front cover in place. Of course, this is quite a dangerous design, as it makes it
    quite easy to access the live terminals.
  </p>

  <h3>Fused power socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This power socket is quite a bit thicker than the one shown earlier: that's because it contains two rewireable fuses
    inside, one for each contact (a practice known as double-pole fusing, which was very common back in the day).
  </p>
  <p>
    Fused sockets were somewhat popular in the early days of electricity, but didn't last particularly long. The idea
    was that you could have a single high-amperage circuit for the entire house, with individual protection at each
    outlet.
    This would have limited the inconvenience of a blown fuse, though obviously replacing a fuse on a socket next to the
    floor is much more inconvenient than having them all in a single location.

  <h3>Three-phase ceramic socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: unknown</i></p>
  <p>
    This socket is constructed similarly to the ones shown earlier, but it's a three-phase version, designed to work
    with the old Italian <a href="plugs_ita_old.html#threephase">three-phase</a> plugs (and specifically, only the
    non-earthed ones).
  </p>
  <p>
    The holes are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, which means that the plug can be inserted in any
    way - not a problem for three-phase, of course. The smaller holes are just for the mounting screws.
  </p>

  <h3>German-made bakelite light switch</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    Lever-style light switches like this one became more common in the 50s, during the transition from surface-mount
    devices to ones meant to go in a wall box.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notably, the screw terminals on this one can be accessed just by twisting the front cover, a huge safety flaw as
    that's very easy to do and reveals live connections that are very easy to touch.

  <h3>Vimar 10A socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a later style of (non-earthed) surface-mount socket, made by Vimar. It's made of plastic, with a ceramic
    section on the back to hold the metal contacts with place, similarly to other sockets of the time.
    Holes have been cut out on the plastic to run wires, which at this time would have likely been early PVC
    single-insulated ones.
