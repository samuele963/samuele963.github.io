  <h2>Modern Italian electrical items</h2>

    Italian plugs and sockets are quite different from the ones found in the rest of Continental Europe.
    Italy has traditionally used the "type L" standard, consisting of two sizes of plug (10 and 16A) with a central
    earth pin.
  </p>
  <p>
    While these are still available, very few appliances still come with them nowadays, mostly seeing use on power
    strips and extension cords; instead, <a href="plugs_schuko.html">Schuko</a> plugs as seen in the rest of Europe
    have become common.
    However, most sockets aren't compatible with them, leading many to use adaptors.
  </p>

  <h3>Standard Italian 16A and 10A sockets</h3>
  <p>
    As with the plugs, sockets are available in 16 and 10A versions. The 16A ones are the most common, and these days
    are all "<span lang="it">Bipasso</span>", that is, they accept either size of plug. This wasn't the case originally,
    as the two plugs were meant for <a href="history.html">different tariffs</a>. These older sockets are quite
    uncommon nowadays, but may still be found in older installations.
  </p>
  <p>
    It should be noted that Italian sockets are all modular - that is, they're made of different modules which can be
    connected together to form many different types of layouts.

  <h3>Italian "Schuko" power sockets</h3>
  <p>
    Since Schuko plugs have become so common, sockets compatible with both standards have gained in popularity, and are
    often present in newer installations.
    The type generally seen is compatible both with 10 and 16A type L plugs as well as Schuko ones; however, there is
    also a less common version which is essentially the same as a standard Schuko one but with an earth hole for
    10A plugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared to standard Schuko sockets, these have a wider opening, to enable the use of type L 10 and 16A plugs.
    They also often have a smaller recess, though it is still deep enough to provide adequate protection against
    touching the live pins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adoption of these sockets has been quite slow until recently, and even in newer houses standard 10/16A ones are
    often the ones used for most things - this is due to their higher cost, and them taking up twice the module space.
  </p>

  <h3>Standard 10A and 16A plugs</h3>
  <p>
    These are the types of plugs traditionally used in Italy. As previously mentioned, there are both 10 and 16A ones,
    which have different pin sizes and spacing, as they were originally meant for different voltages and tariffs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nowadays, there are few appliances that still use these plugs, generally laptops and some desktop computers. In
    practice, they're mainly found on things like power strips, especially in the case of the 16A one.
    While appliances don't use them anymore, type L plugs are still the default style used for rewireable plugs,
    which makes sense as they're compatible with most sockets.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the same reason, these are also the types of plugs most power strips use, though these days it's common for them
    to use the Schuko-compatible sockets, for compatibility with most types of appliances.
  </p>

  <h3>BTicino 10A plug</h3>
  <p>
    This is one of the many styles of rewireable plugs available, in this case made by BTIcino. The main feature of this
    one is that its pins can change orientation, to be either on the front or on the side.
    Having the pins set up from the side makes this plug take up very little space, which can be useful for sockets
    placed behind furniture.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main problem with this plug is that neither of the two orientations are compatible with a Schuko-compatible
    socket. Given that these are becoming more and more common, it seems like continuing to sell these styles of plugs
    is a bad idea, even if they have quite a clever design.

  <h3>Sockets for round boxes</h3>
  <p>
    While very rarily installed nowadays, round wall boxes, as well as electrical accessories compatible with them,
    are still available for purchase today.
    Generally though, the main reason for buying a socket or light switch compatible with the round box standard is to
    replace an existing one in an older house.
  </p>
  <p>
    Replacing old sockets is quite a good idea, not just due to wear but also because older sockets may not work well
    with modern plugs that don't use split pins. Additionally, older 16A sockets weren't of the "Bipasso" type and thus
    required an adaptor to connect 10A plugs.

  <h3>Schuko adaptors</h3>
  <p>
    As previously mentioned, it's quite common for appliances to use Schuko plugs even though most sockets aren't
    compatible with them. As such, adaptors like these, which convert from one type to the other, are extremely common.
    Another solution is to use a power strip with sockets that accept both types of standard, which are very easily
    found and the most common type sold nowadays.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that, by law, these have to be rated at 1500W maximum. However, they are regularly used for much higher
    loads, such as hairdryers and clothes washers.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the idea of using adaptors might seem dangerous (and, to be fair, it does introduce an extra point of failiure),
    keep in mind that these are nothing like the <a href="travel_adaptors.html">travel adaptors</a> used on holidays.
  </p>

  <a href="images/plugs_ita/adaptor_02b.jpg"><img src="images/plugs_ita/adaptor_02b.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <p>
    Adaptors that go the other way around, that is, enabling the use of Italian plugs on Schuko sockets, are also
    available though understandably not very popular. They can be useful however for plugs that aren't compatible
    with the recessed Schuko sockets, or for anyone going on holiday.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both styles are available either as simple adaptors or as multiway ones, which enable plugging in multiple appliances.
