  <h2>Electrical items from the UK</h2>
  <p>
    British electrical items are surprisingly different than Contental European ones, despite the grographical proximity
    and use of the same voltage. They're built as a single block, with the faceplate being part of the device itself
    instead of being separate piece, while the (1-gang) wall boxes are similar to the round european ones but not quite
    the same.
  </p>

  <h3>Standard power socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 13A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a very common style of power socket. Most ones in the UK and Ireland are double ones, but this isn't always
    the case; similarly, the majority of them have a built-in switch to cut power to the outlet, but unlike Australian
    ones this isn't an actual requirement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wiring is fairly simple, with screw terminals located on the back; screwless terminals are now available in the UK,
    but it's not yet a common feature, generally being found only on high end devices.<br>
    As this is entirely a single-block device, the front contains two holes for mounting to the wall box; covers
    are provided in order to prevent the screws from being visible.

  <h3>Single power socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 13A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a single power socket, meant to go in a one-gang box. It's very similar to the one shown above, but with
    only one outlet and with no power switch.
  </p>
  <p>
    One interesting feature found on all of these sockets is the metal bar connecting the earth terminal to the mounting
    screws. This is because metal wall boxes are quite common in the UK, and require being connected to earth.

  <h3 id="lightswitch">One-way light switch</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a very standard light switch as found in the UK. This specific one is a one-way switch, used for turning on
    a light from a single point - as such, it only has two terminals. There are also two-way and intermediate switches
    for turning on lights from multiple locations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The depth of the switch is considerably narrower than most other ones from other countries - that's so that it can
    fit in very shallow wall boxes, which are often used for mounting light switches there.

  <h3>Fused connection unit</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 13A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This device is used to connect a hard-wired appliance. UK circuits are generally protected by a 32A breaker, so
    a fuse (13A, can be swapped for lower values) is necessary to protect the power cord of the device; there's also a
    double-pole switch for isolation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fuse can be swapped easily by removing the fuse holder at the front (which can't be extracted fully, so it's
    impossible to lose it). An indent is present in the plastic, which can be broken off to pass a cord through, and a
    cord grip is present to secure it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Essentially, this device offers the same features as a plug and socket would, but without actually being a plug and
    socket.
