  <h2>Old Italian electrical accessories</h2>
  <p>
    The design, styling and general shape of sockets and light switches in Italy has varied considerably throughout
    the years. Indeed, while in other countries their styling hasn't changed <i>too</i> much since the 50s-60s, in
    Italy a lot more attention has been paid to their design, which has thus evolved over time according to the style
    of the period.
  </p>
  <p>
    Models of electrical accessories made by different manufacturers are known as "series". Various series have been
    made over time by various manufactuters, each with a different appearance.
    Traditionally, BTicino has been a trendsetter, with their styling influencing and being cloned by many other brands.
