  <h2>European fuse boxes</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional fuse boxes in Europe could vary considerably between countries; however the most common style, at
    least outside the UK, were the <b>Diazed</b> fuses created in the early 1900s in Germany.
    These used cartridge fuses held in a removable cap that could be unscrewed to change the fuse.
    Later on, the more compact Neozed fuses were introduced, which are still installed nowadays for some special
    applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the UK, on the other hand, the most common style of fuseboxes by far were ones using rewireable fuses.
    These aren't currently in the collection, however rewireable fuses were also often found in some
    <a href="fuses_ita.html">Italian</a> fuse boxes.
  </p>

  <h3 id="diazed">The Diazed fuse system</h3>
  <p>
    This style of fuses, originally created in 1906 in Germany by Siemens, was <i>the</i> default in Europe, being
    used for more than half a century. In fact, parts and replacement fuses for existing boards can even be purchased
    today.
    A few different sizes of Diazed fuse exist - DII being by far the most common, with a maximum rating of 25A.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like the fuses used in <a href="items_american.html">North America</a>, Diazed fuses use an Edison screw socket.
    However, in this case the fuse is a separate cartridge, which then is placed into a cap which is what actually screws
    into the E27 socket.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/diazed_01a.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/diazed_01a_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/diazed_01b.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/diazed_01b_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/diazed_01c.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/diazed_01c_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <p>
    The fuse cartridges are shaped like a bottle, with the neck having a thicker diameter the higher its rated
    current is. On the other hand, fuse holders have a gauge ring (which can only be removed with a special tool)
    which prevents fuses of a higher current from being used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the fuse is blown, a small spring-loaded button present at the end of the fuse pops out, and can be seen
    from the glass window present in the holder. The colour of the button depends on the rating of the fuse, and
    can also be seen on the gauge ring in the fuse base; the most common colours are red for 10A, grey for 16A and
    yellow for 25A.
  </p>

  <h4>Vintage replacement breaker by Siemens</h4>
  <p>
    This is a vintage replacement breaker meant to be used to replace Diazed fuses. New versions of these are still
    being manufactured and sold nowadays, however this is a very early model, manufactured by Siemens.
    The breaker features a reset button as well as a button to manually turn off the power, as well as some text with
    its rated trip current (6A).

  <h4>DIII three-phase fuse holder</h4>
  <p>
    This vintage fuse holder, by Italian manufacturer Cafrullo, is a three-phase model that accepts DIII fuses up
    to 63A.
    This means that, if used at its rated maximum, it could be used for a 43kW load! However, in the real world,
    this was likely not installed with fuses of that size.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_01a.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_01a_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_01b.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_01b_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_01c.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_01c_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <p>
    The use of Diazed fuses is a bit odd in Italy, where they weren't common at all; however, they were used for
    industrial applications, which is almost certainly the intended application for this one, especially given its
    maximum rating.
    Notably, this fuseholder doesn't have any sort of way to install a gauge ring - as such, it's possible to
    install fuses of any size in it. Perhaps it was assumed that this was less likely given the intended usecase.
  </p>

  <h3 id="neozed">Neozed fuses</h3>
  <p>
    The Neozed standard of fuses was designed as a replacement to the Diazed system, and, in some countries, slowly
    replaced it in newer installations, though the Diazed system continued to be very popular.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most common fuse sizes are D01, for currents up to 16A, and D02, for currents up to 63A.
    D01 fuses use an E14 screw thread, while D02 ones use an E18 one. Using them is the same as in the Diazed sysem,
    with a screw cap which the fuse goes into.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the use of Neozed fuses (especially the D01 ones) has become significantly less common for standard circuits,
    they're still found as main fuses for breaker panels in Germany and Austria.
  </p>

  <h3 id="dl">East German DL fuse holders</h3>
  <p>
    The DL system was a fuse standard specific to the GDR, created as a space-saving successor to the older Diazed
    system, using the smaller E16 socket.<br>
    The design of these fuses is very similar to Neozed D01 ones, however the maximum rating is 20A instead of 16.
    DL fuse cartridges are still being manufactured today for replacements, though unless you're replacing a 20A one
    it makes sense just to buy Neozed fuses instead, as the two systems are so similar that D01 fuses up to 16A will
    fit in DL holders.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/dl_01a.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/dl_01a_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/dl_01b.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/dl_01b_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/dl_01c.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/dl_01c_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <p>
    This bakelite fuse holder, built for the GDR market, is able to hold one DL fuse.
    Opening it up can be done easily, by removing the fuse and then removing the single screw holding the front
    cover on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wiring is also very simple, with screw terminals connecting to the line and load sides of the screw thread, as
    well as a small terminal block for the neutral connection (to which a small remnant of wire can be seen).
  </p>

  <h3 id="breakers">Early Busch-Jaeger breaker</h3>
  <p>
    This is a very early DIN-rail mountable circuit breaker, from German manufacturer Busch-Jaeger.
    Contrary to modern circuit breakers, which use a lever to turn the power on or off, this one uses pushbuttons, like
    the replacement breaker for Diazed fuse panels shown above.
  </p>
  <p>
    The breaker came in a very colourful box, with a small instruction sheet detailing how to mount it to a DIN rail.
    Interestingly, it's 1.5 modules wide, compared to modern single-pole breakers which are generally all one module
    wide - this makes sense, given just how old this device is.
