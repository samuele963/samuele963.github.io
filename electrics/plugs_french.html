  <h2>French-style plugs and sockets</h2>
  <p>
    "French" sockets (which, despite the name, have likely originated in Belgium) are quite interesting, as they're the
    only style in use in residential installations to use a metal pin protruding out of the socket to provide an earth
    connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with the <a href="plugs_schuko.html">Schuko</a> ones, it uses plugs with pins of 4.8mm diameter spaced 19mm apart,
    and the sockets have a deep recess to prevent touching the live pins.
    Unlike on the Schuko system, though, these plugs are polarised - that is, they preserve the distinction between line
    and neutral. However, there isn't a set standard for which connection is supposed to be which, so for all intents and
    purposes this isn't really a polarised plug.
  </p>
  <p>
    This style of socket is in use in France, Belgium, Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, as well as parts of Africa.

  <h3>Standard power socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a fairly standard type of French-style power socket, which mounts to the round European <a href="wiring.html#wallboxeu"">wall boxes</a>.
    Safety shutters are present, as that is a mandatory feature in some countries using this standard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly to Schuko sockets, removing the front screw reveals the wiring connections, which in this case use screw
    terminals.

  <h3>Rewireable plug and connector socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    These are two common rewireable plugs and one connector socket, as used for example on extension cords.
    Interestingly, one of the plugs as well as the socket have handles on the side, which help with disconnecting them.
  </p>
  <p>
    An interesting feature of "traditional" French-style plugs (compared to the CEE 7/7 ones used on appliances nowadays)
    is that they are completely round - this prevents them from being plugged into Schuko sockets, as they'd interfere
    with the tabs found on the side of them.

  <h3>Legrand double socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a very interesting type of socket, manufactured by Legrand. It has two sockets built into one device, with
    the faceplate being a single plastic piece. This is in contrast with how mounting two sockets is usually done;
    normally the sockets are separate items with a separate faceplate connecting them together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Installing this socket in a wall box generally involves removing the separator between the two halves of the boxes,
    as this is a single device. Then, mounting is done similarly to other types of sockets.
  </p>

  <h3>Surface-mount power socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This style of power socket would be used in places with surface wiring, such as a garage. The socket is made entirely
    out of plastic, which indentations where it can be cut into to feed a cable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The front cover is held with one screw, which is removed to mount the socket and connect the wire terminals. As this
    was made by the same manufacturer as the other socket shown previously, the terminals are exactly the same, and even
    use the same plastic piece.
  </p>

  <h3>Multi-way adaptor</h3>
  <p>
    This is a three-way adaptor, used to connect up to three devices to a power socket. Its design is similar to Schuko
    ones, however due to French sockets being polarised it only can be plugged in in one way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interestingly, this adaptor uses a CEE 7/6 plug on it instead of a hybrid 7/7 Schuko/French plug; however, this isn't
    universal, other models of multi-way adaptor are available with 7/7 plugs.
  </p>

  <h3>Power strip</h3>
  <p>
    This small power strip, which can be used to connect up to three devices, is quite simple: it features an illuminated
    power switch and a cord with a CEE 7/7 plug.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are, however, two interesting things about it: the first is that, despite French plugs being polarised, only
    two of the outlets are wired correctly, as the correct way to wire them up isn't mandatory and can vary between
    countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, despite this power strip being rated at 3680W, it only uses a 1mm<sup>2</sup> power cord. This is quite
    concerning, as that's considerably more than the maximum rating of that size of wire, especially under plastic
    insulation.
  </p>

  <h3>Vintage twistable plug from Legrand</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 10/16A</i></p>
  <p>
    This old plug has a quite interesting design, as it allows the cord grip to be set at three different angles.
    Changing orientation can be done by taking apart the plug, which is made of two pieces, and placing them back
    together at the desired angle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having a twistable plug can be quite useful for these types of plug, as it can avoid having the cord grip interfere
    with a plug on an adjacent socket.
