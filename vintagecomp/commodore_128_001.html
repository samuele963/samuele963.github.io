  <h3>About this computer</h3>
  <p>The Commodore 128 was an interesting computer: built to be backwards-compatible with the Commodore 64, it never got a ton of software that took advantage
    of its specific capabilities. The 128 came with a Z80 processor specifically to run the CP/M operating system - combined with the C64 emulation this gave
    the system the ability to run a wide variety of software, though most owners probably just used the machine to run software made for the 64.
  </p>

  <p>The Commodore 128 is able to operate in various modes:
    <ul>
      <li><b>C128 mode</b> (40 or 80 columns mode) -  this is the mode thst the 128 normally boots with.</li>
      <li><b>C64 mode</b> - this enabled users to run most C64 programs, with a high degree of compstibility. During this mode all C128 functions are disabled</li>
      <li><b>CP/M mode</b> - the C128 was shipped with a CP/M 3 disk (even though the computer didn't come with a disk drive in the box) - this was one of the
        big selling points of the system: being able to run CP/M applications opened the 128 up to the world of business, which was definiely a big deal (since the
        C64 wasn't all that popular with businesses), however it's important to note that this was 1985: IBM PCs and compatibles had already been in the market for
        multiple years at that point, and CP/M wasn't as big of a deal then as it was in, say 1980.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>I got my 128 at an indoor flea market, with the original box and a semi-broken Datassette. I also bought, some days later, some games and a controller for it.
    Unfortunately I've never been able to get it to work satisfactorly, and now it has stopped working due to a blown fuse in the PSU that I haven't replaced yet.
