  <h3>About this computer</h3>
  <p>Compared to the previous models in the product line the PowerMac G4 Gigabit Ethernet added, as the name implies,
    Gigabit Ethernet networking capabilities, however that model also added other features like the ability to order the
    system in a dual-processor variant (like in my computer) and it introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Display_Connector">ADC port</a>, which carried power, video
    signals and USB to your monitor all on one cable (though it was a massive failure and was dropped from later Macs).
  </p>

  <p>This model used the same “Graphite” case as the earlier G4s, which itself was just a redesign of the Power Mac G3
    Blue and White case. This revision was widely seen as a stopgap release, because higher clocked G4s weren’t available
    yet: the dual CPUs were probably a way to squeeze a bit more performance out of that design of G4s.
  </p>

  <p>
    The speed provided by the dual processors would have accelerated programs that supported them a lot, and thus it’s no
    wonder that, given the expansions inside of it, this computer was very likely used in a video production environment.
