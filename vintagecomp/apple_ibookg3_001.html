  <h3>About this computer</h3>
  <p>The design used by this model departed drastically from the famous "Clamshell" iBook G3s Apple produced previously, and returned to
    a more classical-looking laptop shape, albeit with some interesting quirks: the outer shell is made entirely from a transparent plastic
    (great at attracting scratches, as my particular unit so helpfully shows) that's coated in a white paint from the inside.</p>
  <p>Interestingly enough this model would have been one of the very first Macs to come with OS X from the factory (according to EveryMac
    that would have been version 10.0.4), alongside Mac OS 9.1, though that only applied to later releases of this computer: early units
    just came with Mac OS 9.1.</p>
  <p>I got my specific unit from a friend of mine. Sadly it's not in the best of shape: some of the keys on it are missing, there are a lot
    of scratches on the plastic and originally the factory-installed DVD drive didn't work, so I had to swap in another one which unfortunately
    didn't fit as well as the original one, however it meant that I could reinstall Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X.</p>
