  <!-- <h3>About this computer</h3> -->
  <p>
    IBM ThinkPads were meant for serious business use, and this one is no exception.
    <br>
    Although it doesn't have a 3D-capable video chip, it does have other interesting features for its time period.
    <br>
    Compared to previous models in the 380 family, it came with a Pentium 2 chip, a 1024x768 display, better speakers
    and it was released alongside Windows 98.
  </p>
  <p>
    I got my specific unit at the flea market, and it is in excellent condition.
    <br>
    While it wasn't made to be a gaming machine, and the compatibility with DOS games isn't perfect, it is still very
    nice to start it up and use it. It would pair well with an IBM WorkPad PDA, if I had one.
