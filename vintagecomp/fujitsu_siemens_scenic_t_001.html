  <h3>About this computer</h3>
  <p>
    I haven't been able to find much information about this specific model online, sadly, however from what I can tell this line of computers was
    designed to be used by businesses. The construction of the machine reinforces this idea, since the case is sturdy, offers plenty of expansion
    options despite its small size and the (side panel?) is held closed by Torx thumbscrews. Plus, this computer has a Windows 2000 sticker on it
    and by looking online I've found other models in the Scenic T family of computers with a smart card slot built in - again, reinforcing the
    idea that this was a business computer.

    I got this computer at a local school (it had probably been donated to them by a local business that was upgrading their computers).
    It originally had two CD drives - one on the IDE bus and another (an HP ...) connected to a SCSI card - and no other expansion cards
    installed except for that SCSI card, however I've since upgraded it with an IDE DVD drive (and I kept the SCSI CD drive), a graphics card,
    a sound card and an Ethernet card (the last two cards were added because I couldn't find drivers for the on-board sound and Ethernet controllers,
    but if I manage to find those drivers I'll remove those cards).

    This computer was once my main Windows 98 PC, but I've since been using <a href="beigebox_p4_001.html">another one</a> for that purpose.
