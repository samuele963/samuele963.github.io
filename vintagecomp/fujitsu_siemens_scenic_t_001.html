  <h3>About this computer</h3>
  <p>There's not much information on this model sadly, so I'll just describe my specific unit:<br>
  This model appears to have been built with business/workstation use in mind: the case is sturdy, it uses Torx thumbscrews to hold the covers closed and, most importantly, there is a "Designed for Windows 2000" sticker on it.<br>
  I've also seen other models in the Scenic T family of computers with smart card slots built in - again, reinforcing the idea that this was a business computer.</p>
