  <h3>About this computer</h3>
  <p>I bought it at a flea market, without knowing if it worked or not, though it seemed to be in good physical condition and the LCD on it wasn't
    cracked, so I decided to buy it anyways. It came with the original carrying bag, some floppies for the OS and the setup menu and some unrelated
    accessories.
  </p>

  <p>After getting it home I plugged it into a DC power adaptor and tried to power it on, but unfortunately nothing happened. However, while it was
    plugged in I noticed a weird smell coming out of the laptop. Long story short, after opening it up I was greeted by this:
  </p>
  <a href="./images/toshiba_juice1.jpg"><img src="./images/toshiba_juice1.jpg" alt="(The power supply board was completely covered in acid from the leaky capacitors)" height="140"></a>
  <a href="./images/toshiba_juice2.jpg"><img src="./images/toshiba_juice2.jpg" alt="(Another picture of the board, completely covered in cap juice)" height="140"></a>
  <p>All the capacitors on the DC-DC power board were leaky, and needed replacing.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, even after removing the old capacitors, cleaning the board, buying new ones and installing them I still couldn't get the computer
    to start up. I'm not sure what the problem might be - it could be that the caps on the motherboard need to be replaced too, or maybe one of the
    traces on the PSU board has been damaged and needs repair - I don't know. For now I have abandoned this project, but I might come back to it some other day.</p>
