  <h3>About this computer</h3>
  <p>I bought it at a flea market, without knowing if it worked or not, though it seemed to be in good physical condition and the LCD on it wasn't
    cracked, so I decided to buy it anyways. It came with the original carrying bag, some floppies for the OS and the setup menu and some unrelated
    accessories.

  <p>After getting it home I plugged it into a DC power adaptor and tried to power it on, but unfortunately nothing happened. However, while it was
    plugged in I noticed a weird smell coming out of the laptop. Long story short, after opening it up I was greeted by this:

  <p>All the capacitors on the DC-DC power board were leaky, and needed replacing.</p>
