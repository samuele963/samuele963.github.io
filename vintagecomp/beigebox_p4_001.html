  <h3>About this computer</h3>
  <p>
    This PC is interesting because it has one of the first Pentium 4 processors in it, released in late 2000. It also used
    RDRAM (like the N64!), which was a faster alternative to the SDRAM commonly used at the time, however that type of RAM was
    proprietary, ran hot (requiring heatsinks) and it was much more expensive - once DDR RAM was released that was the final
    nail in the coffin for RDRAM.

    This computer was actually a dumpster find, and unfortunately it has some scratches, most likely because of the way it was
    stored in that dumpster, however they aren't <i>that</i> bad thankfully. The previous owner had left a lot of personal files on
    the hard drive (which have all been deleted now, of course), and it appears that they were using this computer with a scanner
    and some kind of camera, which would also explain the extra parallel port PCI card that was installed in the system.

    It originally came with two IDE CD drives, an Nvidia Vanta (16MB) video card and a PCI parallel card, however I've upgraded
    it quite a bit with a DVD drive, a SCSI Jaz drive, a better video card and some other expansion cards.

  <p>This is currently my main Windows 98 computer.</p>
