    <h2>Eltos - a mysterious Italian video company</h2>
    <p><i>Note: this page is still unfinished</i></p>
    <p>
      The fist ever video processor I got, which was more or less the spark that got me into experimenting with analog
      video, was the V3000 from a weird unknown company called Eltos. I now have three devices in total from them and,
      importantly, information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eltos was a video equipment manufacturer from Italy; while any specific information about them seem to have been
      lost to time, by what I can tell they seem to have been moderately popular here in Italy in the prosumer and
      lower end professional market, since I've been able to find a few of their devices on Ebay and other online
      shopping sites.

    <h3>Other products from them</h3>
    <p>
      Their products seem to fall into two categories: on one hand there's the smaller stand-alone units like the ones
      I have. These seem to be the ones more easily found online and thus I imagine the most popular.
      On the other there's their rack-mount devices - these are much harder to find any information about.
