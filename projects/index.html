  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>I'll post about some of my various projects over here, in the hope that they may be useful to someone else.</p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately I don't have a lot of new projects at the moment, so there's not a lot of stuff on this page...
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="dim_bulb_tester.html">Building a dim lightbulb tester to test old radios</a></li>
    <li>(TO-DO:) Making a new power supply for my Commodore 64 (and 128)</li>
    <li>(TO-DO:) Building a "dirty video mixer" for my video setup</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Information about my various collections can be found in the <a href="../other/index.html">other stuff</a> page.</p>
