  <h2>My retro video editing and processing setup</h2>
  <p><b>(This page is still being worked on. What you see here isn't the final product and will probably change quite a bit)</b></p>

  <p>I've been slowly collecting various video editing devices, mostly from the 80s and 90s, which I currently have connected
    to consumer-grade video sources and recorders.
    <br>
    This setup is still incomplete (for example, I'm lacking a real CRT monitor and a video mixer) and because of that
    I'm still working on expanding my collection, however I though that it'd be a good idea to document the things I have
    now on this page, since there generally isn't a lot of information about these things online.
  </p>

  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <h4>JVC JX-SV77 video processor</h4>
  <a href="images/jvc_overview_001.jpg"><img src="images/jvc_overview_001.jpg" alt="JVC video processor" width="150"></a>
  <p>Featuring a built-in titler, colour correcting capabilities, the ability to wipe to and from a background colour and other features, the JVC
    JX-SV77 is a powerful analog video editing tool of the time.
  </p>

  <h4><a href="eltos.html">Eltos V3000 and V4000</a></h4>
  <a href="images/eltos_001.jpg"><img src="images/eltos_001.jpg" alt="Eltos video units" width="150"></a>
  <a href="images/eltos_v3000_front.jpg"><img src="images/eltos_v3000_front.jpg" alt="Eltos v3000" width="150"></a>
  <a href="images/eltos_v4000_front.jpg"><img src="images/eltos_v4000_front.jpg" alt="Eltos v4000" width="150"></a>
  <p>There's not a lot of info on these units: they were part of Eltos's line of video processing equipment, with my two units
    (and the others that I've seen in online listings) all sharing a common design theme, with an all-metal casing and an
    industrial-looking design.
