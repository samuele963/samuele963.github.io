<h2>Is Linux for you?</h2>
<p><i>Warning, this page is a <b>WORK IN PROGRESS!</b> (I recommend looking at other guides first)</i></p>

<p>Nowadays Linux distributions have improved considerably and it’s easier than ever to use Linux. That being said, Linux isn’t always for everybody. In this guide I’ll talk about what to check for to make sure you won’t have any issues in switching from another OS.</p>

<h3>Games compatibility</h3>
<p>Thanks to the <a href=”https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton”>Proton compatibility layer</a> it is now possible to play many Windows games on Linux (and for non-Steam games you can either add those games to the Steam client or use a tool like <a href=”https://lutris.net/”>Lutris</a>).</p>
<p>That being said, it’s not always possible to play all Windows games via these compatibility layers, especially when a game uses certain kinds of DRM or anti-cheat tools.<br>In that case you might have to keep a Windows installation laying around to play those games.</p>

<h3>Software compatibility and choosing alternatives</h3>
<p>It’s widely known that Adobe’s Creative Cloud series of programs (Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, …) are incredibly popular and a de-facto standard in certain industries. Unfortunately Adobe hasn’t released those programs under Linux, so if you rely heavily on them then Linux isn’t really for you./p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning, however, that programs like <a href=”https://www.gimp.org/”>GIMP</a> and <a href=”https://krita.org/”>Krita</a> <i>can</i> be useful alternatives to Photoshop, and if you need a simple video editor for Linux then <a href=”https://kdenlive.org/”>Kdenlive</a> or <a href="http://www.pitivi.org/">Pitivi</a> are good options.<br><i>(I’ll probably add a separate page listing alternative programs available on Linux some day)</i></p>

<h3>Hardware compatibility</h3>
<p>Hardware compatibility is generally pretty good, however on laptops with Nvidia Optimus you may have to fiddle around with certain settings to make sure everything works as it should.</p>
<p>Also, it's worth noting that if you have certain hardware that require special Windows or Mac-only programs to work you might have some issues - for example with peripherals that use special software to cutomise their LED lighting effects. </p>

<h3>Conclusion: is Linux for you?</h3>
<p>If you have decided that you want to try out Linux, then that's great! I'm working on more guides for beginners to the world of Linux, so make sure to check out this website once in a while to not miss anything!</p>
