  <h2>Modern electrical stuff</h2>
  <p>
    These are some newer rewireable plugs (I keep a few in my drawer in case I need to replace the ones on old electrical equipment,
    things like tube radios etc.), not really noteworthy on their own, but it's interesting to compare them to the plug from
    the 50s showed in the previous pictures (escpecially for people who aren't familiar with how Italian plugs look like).
    <br>
    The plugs in the first picture are all 10A type-L (Italian) plugs, some of them with a ground pin and some of them without
    it, whereas the plug shown in the second picture is of the 16A type, which is slightly more uncommon but it's definitely
    not rare, they're generally used on power strips.
    I don't have any rewireable Shucko plugs to show here, otherwise I'd
    post a picture of one of them too, but if you're really interested in them I'm sure you can find some pictures online.

  <h3>Adaptors</h3>
  <p>
    Since older houses had less sockets, and those sockets often weren't of the right type, adaptors like these were/are
    used quite a lot. I've also seen these used with Shucko plugs jammed into them, which is very unsafe and can break
    the adaptor.
    <br>
    You can see very clearly, in the second picture, that the ground pin on that adaptor has been cut off.
    This was because many older sockets (like the ones I showed above) didn't have a ground hole, so adaptors like
    these wouldn't fit.
