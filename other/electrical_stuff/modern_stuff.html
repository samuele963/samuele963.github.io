  <h3>Rewireable plugs</h3>
  <h4>Type L plugs</h4>
  <p>
    These are some newer rewireable plugs, not really noteworthy on their own, but it's interesting to compare them to the plug from
    the 50s shown in the other pages (escpecially for people who aren't familiar with how Italian plugs look like).
  </p>
  <p>
    The plugs in the first picture are all 10A type-L (Italian) plugs, some of them with an earth pin and some of them without
    it, whereas the plug shown in the second picture is of the 16A type, which is slightly more uncommon but it's definitely
    not rare, they're generally used on power strips.
    I don't have any rewireable Schuko plugs to show here yet, otherwise I'd
    post a picture of one of them too, but if you're really interested in them I'm sure you can find some pictures online.

  <h4>Schuko plugs</h4>
  <p>
    Standard European Schuko plugs are also generally available in hardware stores, although the rewireable ones aren't
    all that common as they'd probably require an adaptor, so if you need to install a plug yourself it generally
    makes sense to use a type L one instead.
    <br>
    Schuko plugs are, however, much more common on power cords that come with appliances, with the plug generally
    moulded on at the factory.

  <h3>Modern Italian sockets</h3>
  <p>
    Some examples of modern Italian sockets, from the Vimar Plana series (a very popular series nowadays).
    <br>
    The second one is an italianised Schuko socket, which means that apart from accepting Schuko plugs it can also
    be used with 10A and 16A type L plugs, since it has the central earth hole and the holes are of the correct spacing.
  </p>

  <h3>Adaptors</h3>
  <h4>Schuko adaptors</h4>
  <p>
    As mentioned in the <a href="general_info.html">introductory page</a>, Italy uses both type L and European Schuko
    plugs, despite the fact that most houses only have sockets that accept type L plugs and not Schuko ones.
  <br>
    Therefore, adaptors are generally used, or a power strip that has Schuko-compatible sockets (most modern ones
    do).
  </p>
  <p>
    These devices are always rated for 1500W maximum, although they're often also used for things like washing
    machines and hairdryers.
  </p>

  <a href="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02b.jpg"><img src="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02b.jpg" height=140></a>
  <p>
    Additionally, adaptors that do the opposite thing also exist, they are less common but they're useful to connect
    type L plugs to "normal" Schuko sockets.

  <h4>Type L to Type L adaptors</h4>
  <p>
    Since older houses had less sockets, and those sockets often weren't of the right type, adaptors like these were/are
    used quite a lot. I've also seen these used with Schuko plugs jammed into them, which is very unsafe and can break
    the adaptor.
    <br>
    You can see very clearly, in the second picture, that the earth pin on that adaptor has been cut off.
    This was because many older sockets didn't have an earth hole, so adaptors like
    these wouldn't fit.
