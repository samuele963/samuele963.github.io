  <h3>Types of plugs</h3>
  <p><img src="images/modern/plugs_compared.jpg" height="100" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    As mentioned in the <a href="general_info.html">introductory page</a>, Italy uses a few different types of plugs.
    The original type L plugs are still in use, but in addition to them the Schuko plugs, as used in the rest
    of Europe, have also become widely adopted. However, most sockets still only accept Italian plugs, leading
    many to use adaptors. Thankfully, Schuko-compatible sockets are starting to be installed increasingly more
    in new or recently renovated houses.
  </p>

  <h4>Type L plugs</h4>
  <p>
    Type L plugs are the original Italian plugs. There are two types, a 10A one and a 16A one, which have different
    pin sizes and spacing (originally this was because they were used with different voltages - more of that in the
    <a href="history.html">history section</a>).
  </p>

  <!-- <a href=""><img src="" height="140"></a> -->
  <p>
    This type of plug, made by Vimar, is interesting because it can be set up with the pins facing in one of two
    directions: either with the pins at a 90 degree angle, or straight on.
    <br>
    Notably, when set up with the pins at a 90 degree angle, the plug cannot fit inside a Schuko-compatible socket.
    Given that they're becoming more and more popular, it seems strange that Vimar sells this plug with that as
    the default orientation.

  <h4>Schuko plugs</h4>
  <p>
    Standard European Schuko plugs are also generally available in hardware stores, although the rewireable ones aren't
    all that common as they'd probably require an adaptor, so if you need to install a plug yourself it generally
    makes sense to use a type L one instead.
    <br>
    Schuko plugs are, however, much more common on power cords that come with appliances, with the plug generally
    moulded on at the factory.
  </p>

  <h3>Standard Italian sockets</h3>
  <p>
    Some examples of modern Italian sockets, from the Vimar Plana series (a very popular series nowadays).
    <br>
    The first one features two 10A socket modules and one 16A one.
    On the other hand, the second one has an italianised Schuko socket, which means that apart from accepting
    Schuko plugs it can also be used with 10A and 16A type L plugs, since it has the central earth hole and the
    holes are of the correct spacing.

  <h3>Adaptors</h3>
  <h4>Schuko adaptors</h4>
  <p>
    As mentioned in the <a href="general_info.html">introductory page</a>, Italy uses both type L and European Schuko
    plugs, despite the fact that most houses only have sockets that accept type L plugs and not Schuko ones.
  <br>
    Therefore, adaptors are generally used, or a power strip that has Schuko-compatible sockets (most modern ones
    do).
  </p>
  <p>
    These devices are always rated for 1500W maximum, although they're often also used for things like washing
    machines and hairdryers.

  <p>
    Additionally, adaptors that do the opposite thing also exist, they are less common but they're useful to connect
    type L plugs to "normal" Schuko sockets.

  <h4>Type L to Type L adaptors</h4>
  <p>
    Since older houses had less sockets, and those sockets often weren't of the right type, adaptors like these,
    which convert between the two different kinds of type L plugs, were (and still are) used quite a lot.
    I've also seen these used with Schuko plugs jammed into them, which is very unsafe and can break the adaptor.
    <br>
    You can see very clearly, in the second picture, that the earth pin on that adaptor has been cut off.
    This was because many older sockets didn't have an earth hole, so any plugs with an earth pin, like these
    adaptors, wouldn't fit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of these adaptors has largely become unnecessary as most houses built in the last few decades come
    with Bipasso sockets.
