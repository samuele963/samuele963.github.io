  <h3>Swiss plugs and sockets</h3>
  <h4>T12 plugs</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    These are two examples of a Swiss T12 plug, the main type of plug used in Switzerland.
    <br>
    It is somewhat similar to the 10A Italian plug, however the earth pin isn't in the middle, which means that
    the plug is polarised: it can only be inserted in one way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both are older models - because of this, neither of them features any sort of sleeving on the pins.
    It should be noted however that newer Swiss sockets are recessed, so this wouldn't be as big of a problem there.

    The second plug doesn't feature a cord grip, however it does have some ridges on the moulding to make it easier
    to plug in and unplug.

  <h4>"Resista" hybrid socket, and T12 plug</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is an interesting Swiss socket, and the plug that went along with it.
    <br>
    It is branded as "Resista", and it's a T14 socket that's also compatible with T12 plugs.
    <br>
    T14 was the standard of plugs used before the current T12 standard; when it was replaced by the T12 standard
    for a brief period you could buy these types of sockets that were compatible with both types of plugs.
    The socket has an earth pin since T14 plugs required the socket itself to have an earth pin - just like with
    the French sockets. However, T14 sockets are not compatible with French plugs.
