  <h2>Electrical items from other European countries</h2>
  <h3>Continental European items</h3>
  <p>
    This is an overview of the electrical items used in most of Europe (which are often based on German standards).
    While similar, generally, to Italian stuff, there are still quite a few differences, primarily in the sockets
    (European wall boxes are different from modern Italian ones and thus the sockets are designed totally differently)
    and certain elements of the way power is distributed inside a home.
  </p>

  <h4>Standard Schuko socket</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a normal type of Schuko socket, as found in most places in Europe.
    It mounts to a standard European wall box (different from the modern Italian ones, although it will work in
    round boxes found in older houses), either using screws or metal "arms" that push outwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    The socket is installed by removing the single screw on the front, which removes the front plastic piece.
    It is then possible to wire it up and install it, then the cover plate can be installed and finally the
    front plastic can be reinstalled.

  <h4>Double Schuko socket</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>This socket solves a particular problem in a very clever way: how to fit two Schuko sockets in a normal wall box,
    which normally only has space for one?
    Of course, it can't create space where there isn't, but it does use the existing space inside the wall box very
    efficiently, in order to avoid having the socket protrude more than necessary. This is achieved by keeping the
    contacts, which the pins of the plugs connect to, inside the space of the wall box, and thus the only thing that
    has to protrude outwards is the front plastic piece.

  <h4 id="diazed">Diazed fuses</h4>
  <p>
    Diazed fuses were the standard type of fuse used in most of Europe (although, <a href="fuse_breaker_boxes.html">
    as mentioned previously</a>, they weren't popular in Italy).
    They're a very clever design: the fuse is bottle-shaped, with the neck having different thicknesses depending
    on its rating. This interfaces cleverly with the fuse holder, a standard Edison socket, which contains a
    special plastic ring which only allows the correct size of fuse to fit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contrary to the fuse types used in <a href="foreign_stuff_american.html">North America</a>, which also used an
    E27 screw socket, the Diazed fuses don't directly screw into the fuse holder - a separate lid is used instead.
    <br>
    Additionally, once the fuse is blown a small metal piece, present on the base of the fuse and coloured differently
    depending on the fuse rating, pops out. This can be seen thanks to a window on the fuse lid and is very helpful
    to find out which of the fuses needs to be replaced.

  <h3>French plugs and sockets</h3>
  <p>
    French-style power sockets are interesting due to being one of the only sockets in use in residential homes to
    use a metal pin protruding from the socket as the earth connection, instead of side tabs like on the German ones
    or a hole like most other standards around the world.
    <br>
    This style of socket is used in some other countries as well, like Belgium, Poland, Czechia and Slovakia.
  </p>

  <h4>Standard French socket</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This particular socket is constructed almost identically as the German one above, as they're both from the same
    brand, just with the earth pin and a different front plastic moulding.

  <h3>Swiss plugs and sockets</h3>
  <h4>T12 plugs</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    These are two examples of a Swiss T12 plug, the main type of plug used in Switzerland.
    <br>
    It is somewhat similar to the 10A Italian plug, however the earth pin isn't in the middle, which means that
    the plug is polarised: it can only be inserted in one way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both are older models - because of this, neither of them features any sort of sleeving on the pins.
    It should be noted however that newer Swiss sockets are recessed, so this wouldn't be as big of a problem there.
  </p>

  <a href="images/foreign_old/swiss_01c.jpg"><img src="images/foreign_old/swiss_01c.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <p>
    The second plug doesn't feature a cord grip, however it does have some ridges on the moulding to make it easier
    to plug in and unplug.

  <h4>"Resista" hybrid socket, and T12 plug</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is an interesting Swiss socket, and the plug that went along with it.
    <br>
    It is branded as "Resista", and it's a T14 socket that's also compatible with T12 plugs.
    <br>
    T14 was the standard of plugs used before the current T12 standard; when it was replaced by the T12 standard
    for a brief period you could buy these types of sockets that were compatible with both types of plugs.
    The socket has an earth pin since T14 plugs required the socket itself to have an earth pin - just like with
    the French sockets. However, T14 sockets are not compatible with French plugs.

  <h4>T14 plug</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    As mentioned above, this was the style of plug used in Switzerland before the current one.
    Its main feature is that the earth connection is done using a pin in the socket (which means that the plug
    has a hole corresponding to that) instead of the pin being on the plug itself like on most other standards.
