  <h2>General information</h2>
  <p>
    Italian electrics are... weird.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you've never visited this site before, this page is for you! It's a brief look at the wonderful world of just
    how weird Italian electrics are compared to most other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    After reading this, you can take a look at the other pages on my site, which talk about these things in more
    detail. I haven't covered all the topics I want to cover yet, so I'd recommend looking again at the site every
    once in a while, to see if there are any changes.

  <h3>Types of plugs</h3>
  <p>
    Most countries in the world generally only have one type of plug in common use, and that makes sense: it creates
    less confusion and it's incredibly convenient for the end user.
    And yeah, if you go look at one of those "types of plugs used in the world" maps, you might see Italy listed as using
    "the type L plug". The thing is, that isn't completely correct.
  </p>
  <p>
    Italy actually uses <strong>4</strong> types of plugs, the ones in this picture:
  </p>
  <a href="images/modern/plugs_compared.jpg"><img src="images/modern/plugs_compared.jpg" height=140></a>
  <p>
    The ones on the right are the original Italian plugs, the "type L" plugs - and as you can see, there are two of them.
    As I talked about <a href="history.html">here</a>, the reason for that is because they were used for different
    voltages. This isn't the case anymore, but the two plug standards are still here.
    <br>
    Plus, there are also the two other plugs: the Europlug (which is compatible with all Italian sockets)
    and the European Schuko plug (which isn't).
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally, most houses just have sockets compatible with Italian plugs, and not Schuko plugs (although it's
    common in newer houses to have sockets compatible with both).
    <br>
    Despite this, most appliances don't come with type L plugs, they come with European Schuko plugs, which are not
    compatible with most sockets.
    Generally the only devices you can buy that use Italian plugs are laptop chargers, or things like extension cords
    and power strips.
    Thankfully it seems like most of the power strips you can buy nowadays <i>are</i> compatible with Schuko plugs.
    <br>
    Because of this, you'll find multiple adaptors like these inside a normal Italian home:
  </p>
  <a href="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_01.jpg"><img src="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_01.jpg" height=140></a>
  <a href="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02a.jpg"><img src="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02a.jpg" height=140></a>
  <a href="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02b.jpg"><img src="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02b.jpg" height=140></a>
  <p>
    These are Schuko to Italian adaptors - a completely common and boring item for anyone living here, but it's
    certainly a weird concept for people in other countries.
    Despite the fact that all of them are rated at a maximum of 1500W, they are often used to connect devices like
    hairdryers and washing machines, which consume much more than that.
    The alternative would be to have either the socket or the plug on the appliance replaced, so it's understandable
    why most people choose this route.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, there are incompatibilities even with Italian plugs: the bigger 16A plugs aren't compatible with
    10A sockets, but a lot of power strips come with 16A plugs on them - meaning that you need to be careful about
    which socket you're plugging things into.
    Thankfully, generally type L sockets are of the 16A variety, although 10A ones are still easily found.
  </p>
  <p>
    And if that wasn't weird enough, there were also the BTicino Magic plugs! In the 60s they tried to make people
    switch over to this new standard of plugs... which then failed. You can read more about this <a href="plugsandsockets.html#magicplugs">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Limited electrical supplies</h3>
  <p>
    Most Italian houses only have 3kW (14A) supplies. That is, once you go over 3kW (more or less, the power meter lets you
    consume a bit more than that briefly) the power meter shuts off, and you have to go turn the main switch back on
    again.
    <br>
    Suffice to say, 3kW isn't enough for... anything really, however most people manage to get by with these low
    supplies - in fact, they amount to about 90% of residential power contracts.
    <br>
    It is possible to get a bigger contract, and that's often done on new or renovated houses in order to power
    things like air conditioners without problems, but they cost more, and even then the maximum you can get in single
    phase is 10kW, if your supplier even lets you do that. You can go a bit higher with a three-phase supply, but
    after 15kW you start getting charged for real power since at that point it's considered an industrial supply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Presumably one of the reasons why we have these limited electrical supplies is that most houses here have a natural
    gas supply, for things like cooking, hot water and heating. So at that point 3kW is enough, if you only turn on one
    big appliance at a time. Most Italians are familiar with the concept of having to turn the meter back on because
    you went over the limit.
  </p>

  <h3>Modularity</h3>

  <a href="images/modern/modularity_01a.jpg"><img src="images/modern/modularity_01a.jpg" height=140></a>
  <a href="images/modern/modularity_02.jpg"><img src="images/modern/modularity_02.jpg" height=140></a>
  <p>
    One thing used in Italy that doesn't seem to have caught on nearly as much in other countries is the use of modular
    systems for light switches, power sockets, etc.
    <br>
    The system works by having a support plate that holds individual modules - those modules can be power sockets, light
    switches, TV antenna connections, etc. Then you can clip the individual modules to the support plate, screw everything
    to the wall box, and finally you can clip on a decorative cover plate which hides the screws and makes everything look
    nice.
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/magicsystem/modules_01.jpg" height="140" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    This is a pretty useful system, which enables for a pretty high degree of customisation, and there are different
    sizes of wall boxes in case you need more space. There are however disadvantages: for one, it tends to make the
    costs of things higher, since there are more separate pieces you need to buy and you need to get ones from the
    same system (the higher cost can perhaps also be explained by the fact that these devices will only really be
    used in Italy and very few other countries).
    <br>
    Additionally, as mentioned earlier, there isn't a single system of modular devices - the wall boxes are of
    course standard, but the systems themselves aren't intercompatible, and there are a bunch of them.
  </p>

  <h3>Other unusual things</h3>
  <h4>Single phase supplies</h4>
  <p>
    Contrary to most other continental European countries, Italy doesn't use three phase in most homes.
    It is available if you want to (although it does cost more), and it's not as hard to get as the UK for example,
    but in general it's not something that most houses will have.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Double pole breakers</h4>
  <p><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_05.jpg" height="110" style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    This is also common in some other European countries, but here all breakers you'll find will break the neutral
    as well as the live. This is almost certainly a result of the double pole fusing used in the past on dual-phase
    supplies (more info about that in the <a href="history.html">history section</a>).
    <br>
    It's also done because, with the way power is distributed here, you can't be certain that the neutral will be
    at exactly 0V and thus safe to touch even with the power off, so having the possiblity of isolating the circuit
    entirely is important.
  </p>

  <h4>Relays for lighting</h4>
  <p>
    Italy loves to use relays to control lights, in situations where you need more than two lightswitches for a
    specific light.
    The advantage of this is that it lets you add a lot of lightswitches - in newer houses it is common to find
    controls for the lighting on every entrance to a room, which ensures that you won't have to fumble around in
    the dark looking for the switch.
  </p>

  <h4>Digital meters</h4>
  <p>
    This is, of course, not at all unique to Italy, but what is somewhat interesting is that here <strong>all</strong>
    power meters have been replaced with digital ("smart") ones.
    These meters also feature a built-in power switch (something you definitely won't see in other countries), both
    as a limiter (because of the limited supplies) and to protect the incoming feed (other places use a separate
    fuse or breaker).
    <br>
    It also means that you can isolate the building without having to call the power company, and the meter's output
    terminals are separate so they don't have to be under a seal, which is quite nice.
