  <h2>General information</h2>
  
  <h3>Types of plugs</h3>
  <p>
    Most countries in the world generally only have one type of plug in common use, and that makes sense: it creates
    less confusion and it's incredibly convenient for the end user.
    And yeah, if you go look at one of those "types of plugs used in the world" maps, you might see Italy listed as using
    "the type L plug". The thing is, that isn't completely correct.
    <br>
    Italy actually uses 3 types of plugs: two of them are "type L" plugs, one being 10A and one being 16A, plus the
    European Shucko plug is very commonly used for appliances and things like desktop computers.
    However, most houses don't actually have Shucko sockets on them, meaning that most people use an adaptor like these
    ones to connect their devices:

  <h3>Modularity</h3>

  <p>
    One thing used in Italy that doesn't seem to have caught on nearly as much in other countries is the use of modular
    systems for light switches, power sockets, etc.
    <br>
    The system works by having a support plate that holds individual modules - those modules can be power sockets, light
    switches, TV antenna connections, etc. Then you can clip the individual modules to the support plate, screw everything
    to the wall box, and finally you can clip on a decorative cover plate which hides the screws and makes everything look
    nice.
