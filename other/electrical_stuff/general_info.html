  <h2>General information</h2>
  <p>
    Italian electrics are... weird.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you've never visited this site before, this page is for you! It's a brief look at the wonderful world of just
    how weird Italian electrics are compared to most other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    After reading this, you can take a look at the other pages on my site, which talk about these things in more
    detail. I haven't covered all the topics I want to cover yet, so I'd recommend looking again at the site every
    once in a while, to see if there are any changes.

  <h3>Types of plugs</h3>
  <p>
    Most countries in the world generally only have one type of plug in common use, and that makes sense: it creates
    less confusion and it's incredibly convenient for the end user.
    And yeah, if you go look at one of those "types of plugs used in the world" maps, you might see Italy listed as using
    "the type L plug". The thing is, that isn't completely correct.
  </p>
  <p>
    Italy actually uses <b>4</b> types of plugs, the ones in this picture:
  </p>
  <a href="images/modern/plugs_compared3.jpg"><img src="images/modern/plugs_compared3.jpg" height=140></a>
  <p>
    The ones on the right are the original Italian plugs, the "type L" plugs - and yeah, there are two of them.
    As I talked about <a href="history.html">here</a>, the reason for that is because they were used for different
    voltages. This isn't the case anymore, but the two plug standards are still here.
    <br>
    Plus, there are also the two other plugs: the Europlug (which is compatible with all Italian sockets)
    and the European Schuko plug (which isn't).
  </p>
  



  
  <p>
    Despite this, most appliances don't come with type L plugs, they come with European Schuko plugs, which are not
    compatible with most sockets.
    Generally the only devices you can buy that use Italian plugs are laptop chargers, or things like extension cords
    and power strips.
    Thankfully it seems like most of the power strips you can buy <i>are</i> compatible with Schuko plugs.
    <br>
    Because of this, you'll find multiple adaptors like these inside a normal Italian home:
  </p>
  <a href="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_01.jpg"><img src="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_01.jpg" height=140></a>
  <a href="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02a.jpg"><img src="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02a.jpg" height=140></a>
  <a href="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02b.jpg"><img src="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_02b.jpg" height=140></a>
  <p>
    These are Schuko to Italian adaptors - a completely common and boring item for anyone living here, but it's
    certainly a weird concept for people in other countries.
    Despite the fact that all of them are rated at a maximum of 1500W, they are often used to connect devices like
    hairdryers and washing machines, which consume much more than that.
    The alternative would be to have either the socket or the plug on the appliance replaced, so it's understandable
    why most people choose this route.

  <h3>Modularity</h3>

  <p>
    One thing used in Italy that doesn't seem to have caught on nearly as much in other countries is the use of modular
    systems for light switches, power sockets, etc.
    <br>
    The system works by having a support plate that holds individual modules - those modules can be power sockets, light
    switches, TV antenna connections, etc. Then you can clip the individual modules to the support plate, screw everything
    to the wall box, and finally you can clip on a decorative cover plate which hides the screws and makes everything look
    nice.
