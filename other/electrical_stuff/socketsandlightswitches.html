  <h2>Vintage sockets and lightswitches</h2>
  <p>
    The design and styling of sockets and lightswitch types in Italy has varied considerably throughout the years.
    Indeed, while in other countries generally their styling hasn't changed very much, in Italy much more attention
    has been paid to their design, which has thus changed quite a bit over time according to the style of the period.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sockets, lightswitches and various other devices meant to go in a wall box are generally known as "series".
    Various series have been released over the years by various brands, each with a different appearance.
    <br>
    A trendsetter in this field was definitely BTicino, whose styling influenced and was cloned by many other brands,
    as you'll see shortly.
  </p>

  <h3>Surface-mount items</h3>
  <p>
    The earliest types of sockets and lightswitches were surface-mount: meant to be screwed directly onto the wall.
    This makes sense, as electricity was still in its early days back then and all houses would have had to be
    retrofitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this style of mounting fell out of fashion in favour of wallboxes, especially as houses started being built
    with electrical installations in mind, they were and still are available for purchase.
    Surface mount items are more of an eyesore, but they make up for it, in certain cases, for their flexibility and
    ease of installation.
  </p>

  <h4>Vimar 10A socket</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: likely 10A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a later style of surface mount socket, made by the company Vimar.
    It's built very simply: the body is made of plastic and there's a ceramic section on the back that holds the
    metal contacts in place. Holes have been cut out in the plastic to make space for the wires.
  </p>

  <h3>Devices for round boxes</h3>
  <p>
    The round box was the earliest type of wall box in use in Italy (prior to that wall-mounted items were used instead).
    This style of box is still used in other European countries, however in Italy it was superseded by rectangular
    boxes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way devices mount to this style of box is quite interesting, and different from modern ones: the box itself
    doesn't have any screw holes, instead the item is held with arms that expand outwards and grab onto the sides of
    the box.
  </p>

  <h4>Early electrical devices</h4>
  <p><img src="images/vintage/old_socket_16.jpg" height=140 style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    Early devices meant for wallboxes were often a more premium alternative to ones that mounted externally to the wall,
    which was at the time much more common (and presumably easier to retrofit).
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared to other models shown later, whose styling was designed to be visible and look good inside a room, these
    early examples instead did the opposite, trying their best to be hidden from sight.
    As such, they were often made with a clear (glass, and later plastic) front piece, to be easier to conceal behind
    a wallpaper, with only the bare miniumum being visible.
  </p>

  <h4>Early three-phase 15A socket</h4>
  <p><i>Rating: likely 15A 380V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is an excellent example of how these early styles of sockets used to work.
    As indicated by the front informative cardboard piece (which likely means that this socket was never actually
    installed), it's made by the company Saigir (?) from Trieste, and it's a three-phase socket with earth connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way this socket is meant to be installed is quite interesting, and totally different from the later styles
    which just had screws on the front or behind a faceplate: the three holes where the pins of the plug go into
    protrude a little, and can be easily twisted off.
    <br>
    After having removed them the front clear plastic piece comes off, revealing the mounting screws.
    Wiring can be done on the back, using the four (3 phases + earth) terminals which are housed in a ceramic piece.
  </p>

  <h3>Dual lightswitch, unknown brand</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 6A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This double lightswitch follows the same general style of installation as the socket shown earlier, although the
    front cover plate is sadly missing.
    It's not clear who actually built this socket, although the distinctive logos present on the back suggest that
    it might perhaps also have been built by the same company, or by another one based in Trieste.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lightswitches themselves are quite interesting as they're a style that's not used over here anymore (although
    it's quite common in North America) - the switch has a plastic lever on the front which sticks out and is moved
    up or down, similar to toggleswitches used in electronic items.

  <h4>The BTicino Domino series</h4>
  <p>
    Released in the 50s, the Domino series was hugely popular and used in a lot of houses built, or retrofitted to
    have electricity, during the decade.
    <br>
    Their design was quite interesting, as they were generally made out of a single moulded piece of bakelite/plastic,
    which (in the case of the sockets) formed both the body of the socket itself and the thing that screwed into the
    wall.
  </p>
  <a href="images/vintage/old_lightswitch_01a.jpg"><img src="images/vintage/old_lightswitch_01a.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <a href="images/vintage/old_socket_13a.jpg"><img src="images/vintage/old_socket_13a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <p>
    On the back there are, as expected, the wiring connections.
    They are formed of screw terminals (thus, capable of also accepting stranded wire) plainly exposed on the back
    and very easy to touch once the socket's removed from the wall.
  </p>

  <!--<h4>The BTicino Piuma series</h4>
  <p>
    The Piuma series is interesting because of its similarity, in a way, to devices made for the US market.
    Like before, each item is a single piece, however in this case the cover plate is separate.
  </p>

  <h4>Other later round box devices</h4>
  <p><img src="images/modern/socket_05.jpg" height=95 style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    While Italy switched in the 60s-70s to the rectangular box standard, items for round boxes were and still continue
    to be made, primarily for replacements for older houses but there's nothing preventing someone from using round
    boxes even nowadays.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, even though the Magic series (which you're about to see) did introduce the concept of rectangular boxes, it was
    still quite common for people to use them with round boxes like they did before.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Devices for rectangular boxes</h3>

  <h4>BTicino Magic modular devices</h4>
  <p>
    The Magic series introduced the idea of modular systems. It was incredibly popular, so much that you can still
    buy replacement parts for it nowadays, and several clones were made.
  </p>
  <p>
    The modular design meant that devices now weren't made of a single block, insted being divided into modules, a
    support plate, and a cover plate. This style of design has been hugely influential and is the way every socket
    or lightswitch is made in Italy nowadays.
  </p>

  <h3>Other types of sockets</h3>
  <h4>"Marbo" fused multi-socket device</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 15A 380V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This device accepts various types of plug: it has a small type L socket, a big type L socket, and two three-phase
    ones.
    It would have likely been useful in a workshop or factory where various types of equipment may have been connected.
    <br>
    The sockets have a maximum wattage rating written next to them: 500W for the small type L one, 800W for the large
    one, and 1000W for each three-phase socket.
  </p>
  <p>
    The device also has a main on/off switch (with a label instructing the user to switch the power off before
    removing a plug, something I'm sure nobody ever actually did), and fuses - the idea probably was that you'd
    have a bunch of these sockets all connected to a single high amperage circuit, and then the sockets can
    are fused down individually.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's interesting to note that the small type L socket is labelled as for "lighting", and it has separate
    terminal connections, which also means that it wouldn't have been conencted to the fuses.
    <br>
    I assume this might have been so that you could easily connect this to a separate lighting circuit for the
    building (with a smaller fuse rating), or maybe for a cheaper lighting supply (I'm not sure if factories of the
    time would have had such a thing like residential buildings did).
