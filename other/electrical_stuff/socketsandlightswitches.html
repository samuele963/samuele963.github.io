  <h2>Vintage sockets and lightswitches</h2>
  <h3>Devices for round boxes</h3>
  <h4>The BTicino Domino series</h4>
  <p>
    The BTicino Domino series was one of the most popular series of sockets and lightswitches during the late 50s,
    being later followed by other ones like the SuperDomino and Piuma ones, and then the even more popular Magic
    series.
    <br>
    The devices mount into a round box, now not as commonly used anymore in Italy, and, contrary to modern ones
    which are modular, they are a single piece which you simply attach wires to and screw to the wall - in a way,
    very similar to the way UK sockets and lightswitches are installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 10A 125V or 6A 250V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a combination socket and lightswitch. The socket itself is a "small" one, and lacks an earth connection.

  <h4>Other BTicino Domino sockets</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: unknown, but other sockets similar to the first two seem to be rated 10A @ 125V or 6A @ 250V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    These sockets are old enough to lack the safety features found in all modern sockets, such as protective shutters, though some
    of them seem to, at least, have a hole for an earth pin.
    <br>
    The 16A socket, in the last picture, is interesting because the earth hole on it is smaller than it normally is:
    so most 16A plugs probably won't fit in it because of this.
    <br>
    Because of the lack of an earth connection in some of these sockets, adaptors with their earth pins cut off are often used
    when connecting appliances to outlets like these.

  <h4>BTicino Magic modular devices</h4>

  <h3>Surface mount sockets</h3>
  <h4>"Marbo" fused multi-socket device</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 15A 380V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This device accepts various types of plug: it has a small type L socket, a big type L socket, and two three-phase
    ones.
    It would have likely been useful in a workshop or factory where various types of equipment may have been connected.
    <br>
    The sockets have a maximum wattage rating written next to them: 500W for the small type L one, 800W for the large
    one, and 1000W for each three-phase socket.
  </p>
  <p>
    The device also has a main on/off switch (with a label instructing the user to switch the power off before
    removing a plug, something I'm sure nobody ever actually did), and fuses - the idea probably was that you'd
    have a bunch of these sockets all connected to a single high amperage circuit, and then the sockets can
    are fused down individually.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's interesting to note that the small type L socket is labelled as for "lighting", and it has separate
    terminal connections, which also means that it wouldn't have been conencted to the fuses.
    <br>
    I assume this might have been so that you could easily connect this to a separate lighting circuit for the
    building, or maybe for a cheaper lighting supply (I'm not sure if factories of the time would have had such a
    thing like residential buildings did), although I'm not certain.
