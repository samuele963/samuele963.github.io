  <h2>Vintage sockets and lightswitches</h2>
  <p>
    The design and styling of sockets and lightswitch types in Italy has varied considerably throughout the years.
    Indeed, while in other countries generally their styling hasn't changed very much, in Italy much more attention
    has been paid to their design, which has thus changed quite a bit over time according to the style of the period.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sockets, lightswitches and various other devices meant to go in a wall box are generally known as "series".
    Various series have been released over the years by various brands, each with a different appearance.
    <br>
    A trendsetter in this field was definitely BTicino, whose styling influenced and was cloned by many other brands,
    as you'll see shortly.
  </p>

  <h3>Devices for round boxes</h3>
  <p>
    The round box was the earliest type of wall box in use in Italy (prior to that wall-mounted items were used instead).
    This style of box is still used in other European countries, however in Italy it was superseded by rectangular
    boxes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way devices mount to this style of box is quite interesting, and different from modern ones: the box itself
    doesn't have any screw holes, instead the item is held with arms that expand outwards and grab onto the sides of
    the box.
  </p>

  <h4>Early electrical devices</h4>
  <p><img src="images/vintage/old_socket_16.jpg" height=140 style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    Early devices meant for wallboxes were often a more premium alternative to ones that mounted externally to the wall,
    which was at the time much more common (and presumably easier to retrofit).
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared to other models shown later, whose styling was designed to be visible and look good in a room, these
    early examples instead did the opposite, trying their best to be hidden from sight in a room.
    As such, they were often made of glass, to be easier to conceal behind a wallpaper, with only the bare miniumum
    being visible.
  </p>

  <h4>The BTicino Domino series</h4>
  <p>
    Released in the 50s, the Domino series was hugely popular and used in a lot of houses built, or retrofitted to
    have electricity, during the decade.
    <br>
    Their design was quite interesting, as they were generally made out of a single moulded piece of bakelite/plastic,
    which (in the case of the sockets) formed both the body of the socket itself and the thing that screwed into the
    wall.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the back there are, as expected, the wiring connections.
    They are formed of screw terminals (thus, capable of also accepting stranded wire) plainly exposed on the back
    and very easy to touch once the socket's removed from the wall.

  <h3>Devices for rectangular boxes</h3>
  <p></p>

  <h4>BTicino Magic modular devices</h4>
  <p>
    The Magic series introduced the idea of modular systems. It was incredibly popular, so much that you can still
    buy replacement parts for it nowadays, and several clones were made.

  <h3>Other types of sockets</h3>
  <h4>"Marbo" fused multi-socket device</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 15A 380V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This device accepts various types of plug: it has a small type L socket, a big type L socket, and two three-phase
    ones.
    It would have likely been useful in a workshop or factory where various types of equipment may have been connected.
    <br>
    The sockets have a maximum wattage rating written next to them: 500W for the small type L one, 800W for the large
    one, and 1000W for each three-phase socket.
  </p>
  <p>
    The device also has a main on/off switch (with a label instructing the user to switch the power off before
    removing a plug, something I'm sure nobody ever actually did), and fuses - the idea probably was that you'd
    have a bunch of these sockets all connected to a single high amperage circuit, and then the sockets can
    are fused down individually.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's interesting to note that the small type L socket is labelled as for "lighting", and it has separate
    terminal connections, which also means that it wouldn't have been conencted to the fuses.
    <br>
    I assume this might have been so that you could easily connect this to a separate lighting circuit for the
    building (with a smaller fuse rating), or maybe for a cheaper lighting supply (I'm not sure if factories of the
    time would have had such a thing like residential buildings did).
