  <h4>BTicino Magic modular devices</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 10A or 16A 250V, depending on the module</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Magic series introduced the idea of modular systems. It was incredibly popular, so much that you can still
    buy replacement parts for it nowadays, and several clones were made.

  <h3>Other types of sockets</h3>
  <h4>"Marbo" fused multi-socket device</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 15A 380V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This device accepts various types of plug: it has a small type L socket, a big type L socket, and two three-phase
    ones.
    It would have likely been useful in a workshop or factory where various types of equipment may have been connected.
    <br>
    The sockets have a maximum wattage rating written next to them: 500W for the small type L one, 800W for the large
    one, and 1000W for each three-phase socket.
  </p>
  <p>
    The device also has a main on/off switch (with a label instructing the user to switch the power off before
    removing a plug, something I'm sure nobody ever actually did), and fuses - the idea probably was that you'd
    have a bunch of these sockets all connected to a single high amperage circuit, and then the sockets can
    are fused down individually.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's interesting to note that the small type L socket is labelled as for "lighting", and it has separate
    terminal connections, which also means that it wouldn't have been conencted to the fuses.
    <br>
    I assume this might have been so that you could easily connect this to a separate lighting circuit for the
    building, or maybe for a cheaper lighting supply (I'm not sure if factories of the time would have had such a
    thing like residential buildings did), although I'm not certain.
