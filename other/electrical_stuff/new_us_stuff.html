  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The American electrical system is quite different from the ones generally used around the world.
    Most devices run at 120V 60Hz, although the power is (in most cases) actually distributed at 240V using a
    split-phase transformer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The design of most electrical items, including sockets, plugs, lightswitches and breaker panels, is quite unusual
    and different from most other places around the world. As such, I'd like to document what I've learnt about this
    system over time, its interesting features, and how it differs from the European electrics I'm used to.
  </p>

  <h3>The plugs</h3>
  <p>
    The most commonly used plugs are the NEMA 1-15P (sometimes referred to as type A) and 5-15P (type B) - respectively,
    the first one does not have an earth/ground connection, while the second one does.
  </p>
  <p>
    A standard US plug is quite simple: the pins are made from two flat pieces of metal which are generally bent over
    to obtain the required thickness (and perhaps to save on manufaturing cost), while (on plugs that feature it) the
    earth pin is round and hollow.
    <br>
    The body of the plug is generally quite small (at least on moulded ones) due to the small size of the pins, in
    fact it's probably the smallest type of plug used around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The plugs often have holes at the end of the pins, a feature that's sometimes thought of as being there to hold the
    plug more firmly inside the socket, however that's actually not what they're for (Technology Connections made a
    good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udNXMAflbU8">video</a> about this). Indeed, plugs without holes do
    exist and are perfectly legal and allowed by code, although they're generally more common in China.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Polarised plugs</h4>
  <p>
    Modern American plugs are generally polarised, that is, they preserve the distinction between line and neutral,
    although unpolarised versions of the type A plug do exist and are generally found on power bricks, so that they can
    be plugged in in either direction, however they are rarely used otherwise.
    <br>
    Very old devices like tube radios, on the other hand, used to come with non-polarised cords as standard, for
    compatibility with older installations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, the NEMA plug was originally unpolarised, and then polarisation (and, later, an earth connection) was
    added in afterwards. From my understanding some early devices with polarised plugs used to use the neutral as the
    chassis ground, which is extremely dangerous as in case of a misconnection the entire case of the appliance would 
    become live!
    <br>
    This was still allowed until a few decades ago for some 240V appliances, using what was referred to as a "three-wire"
    connection (and three-wire cords and outlets are still available as replacements).
  </p>
  <p>
    Polarised plugs and sockets are the main advantage American electrics have over some other plug standards, and as
    such I've often seen this feature hyped up while talking to people online.
    In practice however, it's not actually a big deal - the main place where it's useful, inside the home, is on lamps,
    with very few pratical uses outside of that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lamp sockets are <em>notoriously</em> very easy to get an electric shock from, especially if you accidentally touch
    the outer ring of the socket when removing a lightbulb; by using a polarised plug you can make sure that the
    outer ring will always be connected to neutral, thus reducing the risk.
    <br>
    This is legitimately a very useful feature, however it still doesn't resolve the main issue: that lamp sockets offer
    very little in terms of shock protection. The real solution to the problem would be to change the lamp socket
    entirely, to a design that makes accidental shocks impossible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, even in North America, where polarisation is much more carefully enforced than elsewhere, mis-wirings
    can and do happen. Polarisation is certainly a useful thing, but <em>only</em> relying on it as shock protection (as is
    often the case on lamps, since most circuits generally don't have any additional protection) isn't a very good idea.
  </p>

  <h4>Sleeved pins, or lack thereof</h4>
  <p>
    American plugs are often criticised for their lack of protective sleeving around the pins, which can cause accidental
    contacts when connecting or disconnecting them. Lack of sleeved pins was actually very common on most plug standards,
    as they were introduced before such protections were commonplace, however they were later adapted to include them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The NEMA plug could present a challenge in that regard since it's so small, however I suspect that it could still be
    adapted, as on the Australian plug, which uses the same size of pins (just in a different configuration) and has the
    same rating, sleeved pins are mandatory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, in Japan (which uses the same plugs as the US) plugs with sleeved pins are readily available. While I
    don't know if they're 100% effective, they are still a good idea and it would make sense to implement them in the
    NEMA standard as well.
  </p>

  <h3>The outlets</h3>
  <p>
    The most commonly used type of outlet in North America is the NEMA 5-15R, which you'll find connected to 15A or
    20A circuits. These accept type A and B plugs, and are rated at 15A @ 120V, with a maximum continuous load of 1500W.
    <br>
    On 20A circuits 5-20R sockets may also be found (which accept both 15A and 20A plugs), although these aren't as
    common in residential homes due to their higher cost and since there aren't a lot of devices that make use of them.
  </p>

  <h4>Construction</h4>
  <p>
    The receptacle generally has two power outlets, and mounts to the wall box using a built-in metal piece.
  </p>
  <p>
    ...
  </p>

  <h4>Older outlets</h4>
  <p>
    NEMA 1-15R outlets, with no earth/ground connection, can still be found in older houses that haven't been renovated,
    as earthed sockets were only made mandatory in the 60s, and in fact it is still possible to buy new ones to use as
    replacements.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a house with these old sockets, it's likely that the owner may want to replace the original ones with something
    newer and more reliable, without having to run an earth wire or new wiring entirely (which would be the preferrable option,
    when possible) due to the cost of doing so.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, other than buying some new replacement 1-15R outlets, it is also permitted to replace them with earthed
    sockets, provided that they are protected by a GFCI and that appropriate stickers are used.
    It should be noted (since I've seen some confusion in this regard) that this <strong>will not</strong> create an
    earth/ground connection - it is still missing, and you still won't get the (important) protective benefits of it.
    However, doing this will at least make it so that, if you do get a shock, you'll have some sort of protection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some older types of outlet also supported the previous style of flat blade plug (the original Hubbell design).
    This design can be confused to be a weird early 20A socket (partly thanks to a misleading picture on Wikipedia),
    however that is not its purpose - it was meant to accept both types of plug during the switchover period.
    Both polarised and unpolarised versions of this socket can be found.
  </p>

  <h4>Wiring</h4>
  <p>
    Wiring the sockets can generally be done using two methods, depending on the type of the socket.
    Some sockets allow you to use "push-in" slots on the rear, however this is widely regarded as causing poor
    connections and better outlets generally don't have this option.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best method is to use the screws on the side: the wire goes around them and is then tightened by the screw.
    The screws also have a little metal connection that can be removed in case you want to wire up the two sockets
    to different circuits (for example, you could leave the top one always on while the other one could be controlled
    by a lightswitch) or to different phases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other, more expensive (for example, medical-grade) sockets may use a rising clamp terminal, which is in my opinion
    a better, or at least easier to use, connection method.
    This is how all the sockets I've seen in Europe are wired up, although that's likely for compatibility with
    stranded wire.
  </p>

  <h4>Shutters</h4>

  <h3>Power distribution</h3>
  <p>
    As previously mentioned, North America uses 120V 60Hz instead of the 220-230V 50Hz used in other parts of the world.
    This is, of course, a fairly important distinction just by itself, however it's not the only one.
    <br>
    Power is generally distributed at 240V, using a split-phase system, with two 120V phases.
    This allows higher power devices to use both phases to get the full 240V while lower powered devices can use one of
    the phases to get 120V. <!-- needs rewriting -->
  </p>
  <p>
    ...
  </p>

  <!-- Things I still need to talk about:
  - power distribution and wiring
  - breakers and breaker panels; how they differ compared to European ones
  - 240V outlets and their naming
  - GFCIs; why they're not common  (where to put AFCIs?)
  - light switches and other types of in-wall devices  (move upwards?)
  - other devices and adaptors
  - safety (or lack thereof); layers of protection -->
