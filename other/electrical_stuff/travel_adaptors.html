  <h3>Dangerous travel adaptors</h3>
  <p>
    Travel adaptors are notoriously unsafe - generally that's because they're trying to be as cheap as possible to produce
    while being compatible with the most plugs.
    <br>
    Unfortunately, this means that they can be dangerous. The most common flaws are bad connections (due to the fact that
    they try to be compatible with as many plugs as possible), lack of earth connection, lack of sleeving on the pins,
    and lack of protective shutters.
  </p>

  <h4>EU to US 2-pin adaptor</h4>
  <p>
    One example of a dangerous travel adaptor is this one I have, which converts a variety of two-pin plugs into a North
    American one. The biggest flaw it has is the lack of safety shutters, which isn't great considering how big the
    holes in the socket are - you could fairly easily touch the live connections with your finger.
    Plus, the lack of shutters means that it's possible to insert only one of the pins of a plug into it, which would
    leave the other exposed pin live and easy to touch.

  <h4>The infamous "deathdaptor"</h4>
  <p>
    This style of travel adaptor is notorious online for just how terrible it is, so much in fact that it's
    generally referred to as the "deathdaptor".
    It presents all of the possible flaws you could possibly find with these types of devices - first of all, the
    holes on it are rather large in order to accomodate different types of plug, and rather poorly built, which
    can easily lead to poor connections which in turn poses a fire risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the holes don't have any shutters on them, which makes it easy for someone to stick a metal
    object inside and receive a shock, and more importantly it allows for the user to connect a plug in a dangerous
    way, for example with the earth pin connected to live, which is extremely dangerous.
    <br>
    The holes on the adaptor aren't even made properly, I tried connecting a 10A type L plug to it, as it clearly
    features holes for the earth pin on it, and it just got jammed inside, either due to the shoddy constrution
    or the holes not being designed for the right pin thickness in the first place.
  </p>
  <p>
    And finally, the pins on the plug side (which in this case are for use in Italy) aren't even sleeved.
    Sleeved pins have been mandatory on plugs for ages here, so, if there was any doubt about the questionable nature
    of these adaptors, this confirms that they simply aren't made with any safety regulation in mind.

  <p></p>

  <h4>Other designs can also be dangerous</h4>
  <p>
    Looking online at other travel adaptors reveals that many of them share the same flaws. Now, it's understandable
    that these adaptors aren't designed for permanent use and thus they may not have all the safety features of normal
    plugs and sockets, but some of the flaws I've seen with these are just inexcusable.
  </p>

  <h3>A better design</h3>
  <p>
    So, what do you do if you need to buy a travel adaptor? Well, what I'd recommend is trying to find something like this:
    <br>
    This is a Schuko to Australasian travel adaptor, and the key feature of it is that it only has the socket for your
    specific country. This is <b>extremely</b> important in the case of Schuko devices, since they rely on the socket
    itself for the earthing and for protection against accidental contact with the live pins (the socket is recessed
    to prevent this, but that doesn't happen with the cheaper universal travel adaptors).
    <br>
    The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that it doesn't have protective shutters, but that's not a big problem.
    <br>
    Plus, it can be helpful to look up the plug country you're staying in to make sure that the travel adaptor isn't
    missing any features (for example, a lot of the italian travel adaptors I've seen online have pins that aren't sleeved).

  <h3>Useful tips for people travelling to Italy:</h3>
  <p><i>(Obviously this isn't really the time to travel right now, but these tips might be useful once
    people can travel safely once again)</i>
  </p>

  <p>First of all, let's start with the obvious thing: if you're coming from a country that uses 120 (or 100) volts, you need
    to be sure that the devices you want to connect over here can also run on 230V. This is practically guaranteed to be the
    case for things like phone and laptop chargers, but, as an example, you won't be able to use hairdryers designed for 120V over here, so
    make sure the place you're staying in will have one that you can use.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're coming here from a place that uses Schuko plugs and sockets (like Germany) then you're lucky, because your
    phone charger will likely use a Europlug, and that is also what we use over here. However, you may need to get an adaptor
    to use Schuko devices, since most houses don't use Schuko sockets... this is also what people living here need
    to do to plug things like computers and washing machines into the wall, because Schuko plugs are incredibly common, but
    Schuko <b>sockets</b> are less common, except on things like power strips, where they're fairly common because
    <i>people want to plug in the things they bought</i> (incredible, I know).
  </p>

  <p>Anyways, here's what one of the Schuko to 16A type-L adaptors looks like:</p>
  <a href="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_01.jpg"><img src="images/modern/schuko_adaptor_01.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <p>
    You might also find <b>10A</b> Schuko to type-L adaptors, and these will most likely work fine for most things with
    the added benefit of being able to plug them into 10A type-L sockets, which are a bit more common than 16A ones (not
    that 16A ones are rare, but with a 16A converter you have to use a 16A socket, whereas with a 10A one you can use either
    a 10A or a 16A socket) but if you want to plug in a hairdryer then it's a good idea to use a 16A one, since the Schuko
    plugs and sockets are also rated to 16A and heavier loads like hairdryers could overload a 10A plug.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're coming here from a country that doesn't use Schuko plugs, then you'll have to get a travel adaptor.
    Now, this is where it gets <i>scary</i>, because travel adaptors are generally not known to be all that great, so
    it's probably a good idea to search a bit for one that looks secure. Ideally you'd want one whose socket part ONLY accepts
    plugs from the country you're coming from, but those are a bit harder to find.
    <br>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, you should look for adaptors with protective sleeving on the pins - all modern Italian plugs have them and
    they're a really important safety feature, so make sure the one you're buying has that (I've seen quite a few of
    them that don't have any sleeving).
