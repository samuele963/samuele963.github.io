  <h2>Travel adaptors</h2>
  <h3>Dangerous travel adaptors:</h3>
  <p>
    Dangerous travel adaptors have been documented extensively by other people, but here's some of the ones I have:
  </p>
  <p>This one is probably the worst; it converts a variety of 2-pin plugs into a North American plug, but it has a lot of
    safety issues: there are no safety
    shutters at all on this adaptor, a feature which even the cheapest travel adaptor seems to have these days, which means
    that it's very easy for anyone to stick metal objects into the live connections. And if that wasn't enough, it's incredibly
    easy to plug only one of the pins of a plug into it, leaving the other pin, now live, exposed and presenting a shock hazard.

  <h3>A better design</h3>
  <p>
    This is an example of a <b>good</b> travel adaptor - in this case it converts an European plug into an Australasian one.

  <h3>Useful tips for people travelling to Italy:</h3>
  <p><i>(Obviously this isn't really the time to travel right now, but these tips might be useful once
    people can travel safely once again)</i>
  </p>

  <p>First of all, let's start with the obvious thing: if you're coming from a country that uses 120 (or 100) volts, you need
    to be sure that the devices you want to connect over here can also run on 230V. This is practically guaranteed to be the
    case for things like phone and laptop chargers, but, as an example, you won't be able to use hairdryers designed for 120V over here, so
    make sure the place you're staying in will have one that you can use.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're coming here from a place that uses Shucko plugs and sockets (like Germany) then you're lucky, because your
    phone charger will likely use a Europlug, and that is also what we use over here. However, you may need to get an adaptor
    to use Schuko devices, since most houses don't use Schuko sockets... this is also what people living here need
    to do to plug things like computers and washing machines into the wall, because Schuko plugs are incredibly common, but
    Schuko <b>sockets</b> are less common, except on things like power strips, where they're fairly common because
    <i>people want to plug in the things they bought</i> (incredible, I know).
  </p>

  <p>Anyways, here's what one of the Schuko to 16A type-L adaptors looks like:</p>
  <a href="./images/modern/schuko_adaptor_01.jpg"><img src="./images/modern/schuko_adaptor_01.jpg" alt="" height="140"></a>

  <p>
    You might also find <b>10A</b> Schuko to type-L adaptors, and these will most likely work fine for most things with
    the added benefit of being able to plug them into 10A type-L sockets, which are a bit more common than 16A ones (not
    that 16A ones are rare, but with a 16A converter you have to use a 16A socket, whereas with a 10A one you can use either
    a 10A or a 16A socket) but if you want to plug in a hairdryer then it's a good idea to use a 16A one, since the Shucko
    plugs and sockets are also rated to 16A and heavier loads like hairdryers could overload a 10A plug.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're coming here from a country that doesn't use Shucko plugs, then you'll have to get a travel adaptor.
    Now, this is where it gets <i>scary</i>, because travel adaptors are generally not known to be all that great, so
    it's probably a good idea to search a bit for one that looks secure. Ideally you'd want one whose socket part ONLY accepts
    plugs from the country you're coming from, but those are a bit harder to find.
    <br>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, you should look for adaptors with protective sleeving on the pins - all modern Italian plugs have them and
    they're a really important safety feature, so make sure the one you're buying has that (I've seen quite a few of
    them that don't have any sleeving).
