  <h2>The evolution of safety in electrical items</h2>
  <p>
    One of the things that becomes very apparent once you start learning about vintage electrical devices
    is just how unsafe they were. It was so easy to come into contact with live parts accidentally, and
    back then they didn't have things like RCDs (aka GFCIs) to save you.
    <br>
    Because of this, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at various electrical items throughout
    the years and analyse their safety, or lack thereof.
  </p>
  <p>
    Italy in particular seems to have started caring about safety later than other European countries did - for
    example, the use of fuses or breakers wasn't even mandatory until the 60s! Of course, nobody in their right
    mind would even think about going without them, but this shows that, presumably, back then they didn't have
    strict electrical codes. Safety improved considerably only in the 80s/90s, and before then I
    presume that it was just up to the installer whether to buy products that had certain safety features
    or to go with a cheaper option.
  </p>

  <h3>The old times</h3>
  <p>
    Let's start by taking a look at some devices used in the 30s and 40s (the pictures were found in an old
    book I have).
  </p>
  <p>
    The power sockets remained the same for many years, with safety features only being added in the 70s, so
    the only distinctive feature older ones have is their material, which was generally ceramic or bakelite.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fuse holders used at the time, on the other hand, were considerably less safe than the ones used in
    later years.
  <br>
    The first one was a model used at the time, it had a porcelain or bakelite lid which unscrewed to reveal
    the fuse wire, which could only be changed when the power was off. Of couse, there was nothing preventing
    the user from trying to change the fuse with the power still on, which could have lead to a shock.
  <br>
    Other models, like the ones in the second and third pictures, held the fuse wire in a removable lid, thus
    the fuses could be safely removed and changed even with the power on.
  <br>
    Finally, there were also some fuses that screwed into place, an option which became more common later on.
  </p>

  <h3>Fuse panels</h3>
  <p>
    However, all of these items had the same flaw: it was very easy to come into contact with the live contacts.
    Many fuse holders, like the one in picture 4, had the connection screws exposed, which mean that you had to
    pay attention not to touch them accidentally when changing a fuse.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the 50s the company BTcino started selling a line of fuse holders that was very popular which had
    some considerable safety improvements over the ones showed above: each fuse holder had its own shut-off
    switch, to cut the power before changing a fuse.
    <br>
    The fuses used were of the cartridge type (although there was also a version available which used rewireable
    fuses), which is generally easier to change than a fuse wire.
    And, most importantly, all the connections were housed inside of the plstic or metal case of the
    fuse holder itself, which made accidental contacts much less likely.
  </p>
  <p>
    These devices weren't without their own flaws, however: while they were much safer, there was nothing
    preventing you from turning on the power switch while a fuse wasn't inserted. Later models were available
    with a lid which covered the fuses unless the power was switched off, however this wasn't commonly found
    in the home, instead seeing more use in industrial applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plus, another safety issue found with most kinds of fuses was the possibility of changing the fuse with
    another one of a different rating, In North American fuse panels you sometimes saw people using pennies
    to replace a blown fuse, and, well, there was certainly an equivalent of that over here as well.
    <br>
    This problem would ultimately be solved by the use of breakers instead of fuses, but that only happened
    years later.
  </p>

  <h3>Plugs and sockets</h3>
  <p>
    Plugs and sockets took a while to improve, safety-wise. Of course, the materials and the design of them
    changed over time, but for many years there weren't substantial safety benefits between a plug from, say,
    the 30s, and one from the 60s, apart from maybe a slightly easier to hold design.
    And, given that, compared to fuses, plugs are something that people actually use and handle every day, I wouldn't
    be surprised if that was one of the easiest ways to get a shock back then.
    <br>
    This lead to a dissatisfaction with the current standard of plugs, which was apparently one of the
    inspiring factors behind the creation of the Magic plugs and sockets.
  </p>

  <p>
    They were primarily designed to be safe, and this part of their design is still perfectly valid even today
    (although they aren't in use anymore).
    <br>
    The most significant safety feature they added was the introduction of shutters in sockets. A complicated
    mechamism meant that the only thing that could open the (single) shutter was the plug itself.
    <br>
    The plug itself, on the other hand, was made so that it was impossible to touch any exposed metal if it
    wasn't inserted fully.
  </p>
  <p>
    These safety features were the main selling point of the Magic plugs - however, in the following years the
    normal Italian plugs also started changing to be safer, by adopting shutters (with the Vimar Sicury patent
    from 1975) and adding protective sleeves on the pins.
    <br>
    So, the Magic plugs had lost most of their advantages.
  </p>

  <h3>Residual Current Devices</h3>
  <p>
  </p>

  <h3>Safety nowadays</h3>
  <p>
    Nowadays Italian electrics are as safe as other countries - and, in some cases, even safer: RCDs are
    mandatory both in new and old installations, and all new sockets have shutters on them, which isn't the
    case in some other countries.
