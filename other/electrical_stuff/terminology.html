  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>
    When talking about electricity it is often common to see people being pedantic about every little detail, which
    can make for rather annoying discussions online.
    <br>
    This page is to explain the terms I generally use on my website and the reasons for my usage of those terms -
    not necessarily so that the pedants will stop complaining (they will always complain anyways), but more as a
    clarification for the people who might be confused at certain terms I use on my site.
  </p>

  <h3>European vs American terms</h3>
  <p>
    Technical terminology does vary between North America and Europe.
    <br>
    On my website, and on Twitter, I generally use European terminology as that's what I'm used to, however
    for convenience I sometimes also use the American terms so it's clearer what I'm talking about.
  </p>
  <p>
    For convenience, I have compiled a list of European technical terms, with their North American counterparts:
  </p>
  <table class="spctable" style="background-color: white; color: black;">
    <tr>
      <th>European word</th>
      <th>American word</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Earth, Earthing</td>
      <td>Ground, Grounding</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Live wire</td>
      <td>Hot wire</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>RCD, RCCB</td>
      <td>GFCI</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>RCBO</td>
      <td>GFCI breaker</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AFDD</td>
      <td>AFCI</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Socket with shutters</td>
      <td>Tamper-resistant (TR) outlet</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Voltage ratings</h3>
  <p>
    On my site I will often use slightly different variations of a certain voltage depending on the context
    - for example, 220, 230, 240 and 250V, or 110, 120 and 125V.
  </p>
  <p>
    While in practice the difference between the various voltages is minimal, it's generally preferrable to
    write down the correct one for the specific context you're talking about.
    Below is a list of where I generally use these voltages and for what reason:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>220V:</b>
        This was the old European line voltage (and still used in some other places) - I'll generally
        use this when talking about electrical history or older items, or when talking about items made
        for some other countries</li>
      <li><b>230V:</b>
        This is the current, standardised, European line voltage (it was a middle ground between
        the old continental European voltage of 220V, and the old UK line voltage of 240V).
        I'll generally use this when talking about the mains voltage in use in Europe</li>
      <li><b>240V:</b>
        This voltage is/was used in some English speaking countries for their mains - most notably, the
        North American split phase system runs at 240V, and the old UK voltage was 240V (and it still often
        referred to by that name). In general however, 240V is only really a thing in English speaking countries,
        so if you want to be precise referring to Europe as using "240V" isn't correct</li>
      <li><b>250V:</b>
        This is generally the rating of devices meant for 230/240V mains, so for example European sockets are
        generally rated at 250V (even though the line voltage is technically 230V).
        Seeing devices with higher voltage ratings than the official mains line voltage is a fairly common
        thing around the world</li>
    </ul>
