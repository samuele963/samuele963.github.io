  <h2>Electrical wiring and distribution around the world</h2>
  <h3>Power distribution in North America</h3>
  <p>
    Most American houses receive power in form of split-phase (three-wire) 120/240V. This means that the transformer
    has a 240V secondary winding, but with a central tap which is connected to earth to form the neutral - thus,
    there are two line ("hot") wires, as well as the neutral.
  </p>
  <p>
    Crucially, this is still a single-phase supply (which is why technically calling the two line conductors "phases"
    is incorrect, though that's a minor nitpick), however since the center tap is the point connected to the earth,
    there is only 120V between either of the two line wires and the earth (ground) instead of 240.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three-phase power is still the way actual high- and medium-voltage is distributed, of course, and commercial
    installations generally have three-phase supplies, with 120/208V and 277/480V being common.
  </p>

  <h3>Earthing systems</h3>
  <p>
    As mentioned <a href="safety.html#earthing">previously</a>, the protective earth (ground) is a crucial safety
    feature in an electrical installation, and thus is mandatory in most countries around the world.
    However, the way that an earthing system can vary quite considerably, not just between different nations but even
    inside the same country, in some cases, which each system having different sets of pros and cons.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this section we'll take a quick look at each system most commonly in use, as well as some more unusual ones,
    the way each is implemented (and thus its material cost), as well as any advantages or disadvantages of a particular
    implementation.
  </p>

  <h4>IEC terminology</h4>
  <p>
    Classification of the different types of earthing arrangements is generally done using terminology set by the
    International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and thus generally only used in 230V countries (equivalent North
    American technical terms will be provided, when available).
  </p>
  <p>
    Most countries around the world use either TN or TT supplies - while in both of these the neutral is generally
    connected to earth at the transformer, they vary in having the user's earth connection be connected to the
    neutral physically (TN supplies), or using the physical earth for this purpose (TT supplies).

  <h4>TN-S supplies</h4>
  <p>
    In these supplies the earth is supplied as a separate wire all the way to the transformer, where it is connected
    to the neutral. This system was quite common in older houses in the UK, where supply wires had a lead outer
    covering which was used as the protective earth conductor.
    <br>
    The main disadvantage to this system is its cost, as an entirely separate wire must be supplied just for the earth,
    however it is also very safe, compared to TN-C and TN-C-S supplies (see below).
  </p>

  <h4>TN-C supplies</h4>
  <p>
    This style of earthing arrangement uses a combined neutral and earth conductor (PEN), for both the roles of
    return current and for the protective earth.
    In practice, this means that the appliance will either have a connection inside of it from the neutral to the
    chassis (this, of course, necessitates a polarised plug), or (more commonly) there will be a connection in the
    socket from the neutral terminal to the one for the earth. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The main advantage of this system is its cheapness: you only need two conductors for a circuit.
    However, there is a huge risk present if the combined neutral and earth is broken at any point - in that case,
    the chassis of the appliance will become live at mains voltage. Addditionally, this system isn't compatible, or
    offers very limited protection, when used with RCDs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice, because of this disadvantage this system is very rarely used nowadays, though it was allowed until
    the 90s in the US for connecting stoves or dryers, and it was common until the 70s in Germany (where it is sometimes
    called "classical zeroing").
  </p>

  <h4>TN-C-S supplies</h4>
  <p>
    In this system there is still a combined earth and neutral (PEN) wire, however it gets split off into separate
    neutral and earth conductors at a certain point (typically the supplier's cutout, power meter, or in North America
    the first point of disconnection), which then never recombine.
  </p>
  <p>
    This system is widely used in Europe (though not in every country), and is the only one used in North America.
    Effectively, it reduces (but doesn't remove completely) the risks of a TN-C system, while still being fairly
    cheap, at least for the power distributor.
  </p>

  <h4>TT supplies</h4>
  <p>
    With these systems the neutral and earth aren't physically interconnected; instead, the earth connection is
    provided purely by an earth electrode.
    This type of supply used to be undesirable before the advent of RCDs, as a short between line and earth would be
    unlikely to immediately trip a fuse or circuit breaker, leaving the fault present for an extended period of time.
    <br>
    However, thanks to RCDs becoming cheaper (and now being a requirement for most things anyways), these supplies
    have become much more appealing, due to not requiring the extra cost of an earth wire of TN-S supplies while also
    not presenting the risk of a broken PEN that TN-C-S supplies have.
  </p>
  <p>
    This system is used in Italy and most of Southern Europe, as well as Japan and Denmark.
