  <h2>Electrical items from North America</h2>

  <h3>Power sockets</h3>
  <h4>Standard 15A outlets</h4>

  <h3>Wiring, fuses and breakers</h3>
  <h4 id="fuses">Vintage Edison screw fuses</h4>
  <p>
    This is the style of fuse that was commonly in use in North America before breakers were common.
    These fuses use an Edison screw socket, the same used in lamp holders, and were generally made of glass (although
    newer ones use plastic with a window on the top) in order to see if the fuse was blown and also to read the label
    where its rating was shown.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major flaw with these styles of fuses was that, since they all used an E26 socket, it was very easy to swap
    them with one of a higher rating, which is very dangerous and can potentially cause a fire.
    While other designs of cartridge fuse, like the <a href="foreign_stuff_european.html#diazed">Diazed fuses</a>
    used in most of continental Europe, solved this problem by having different sizes of fuse, that wasn't possible
    with this style because of its design.
  </p>
  <a href="images/foreign/american/fuse_01a.jpg"><img src="images/foreign/american/fuse_01a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/foreign/american/fuse_01b.jpg"><img src="images/foreign/american/fuse_01b.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <p>
    Later on a solution was created in the form of a different type of fuse, the S-style fuses, which made using the
    wrong fuse more difficult while still retaining compatibility with existing panels (thanks to a fixed section that
    screwed into the normal E26 socket and was meant to be hard to remove for a normal user).
    However, these weren't as common as the normal style of fuses and thus the problem persisted.
  </p>

  <h3>Adaptors</h3>
  <h4>Ground defeater adaptor</h4>
  <p>
    This adaptor converts a 2-pin outlet into a 3-pin one, with a tab meant to be used for the earth connection.
    In theory it's supposed to be used only with a socket that is 2-pin but has a grounded wall-box: the tab would
    connect to the screw holding the faceplate and thus would make it possible to connect devices which need an earth
    connection safely.
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice however, it's just used to bypass the earth connection entirely in old houses that lack it.
    It's a very well known thing, with its intended purpose likely just being an excuse to keep selling these
    adaptors - if you really did have a house with a grounded box it'd make more sense to replace the socket instead of
    using one of these with the likely old and crusty original one.
  </p>

  <h4>Lamp socket to power outlet adaptor</h4>
  <p>
    This adaptor screws to a normal lamp socket and converts it to two 2-pin power outlets, allowing the user to plug
    in electrical devices in situations where they wouldn't otherwise be available.
    It also features a pass-through lamp socket to connect a lightbulb, with a pullcord to turn it on or off.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adaptors like these (often called "current stealers" or "current taps") were used a lot in the early days of
    electricity around the world, since, as at the time it was mainly used for lighting and appliances were fairly
    uncommon, very few power sockets were generally present in a room.
    <br>
    However, these were only available in Europe until the 50s/60s, and their only use nowadays is as a collector's
    piece as there is no practical reason to use one of these.
    It was very surprising, then, when I found out that it still possible to buy brand new versions of these in
    North America, and that they're still sometimes used for certain applications.
  </p>

  <a href="images/foreign/american/adaptor_02b.jpg"><img src="images/foreign/american/adaptor_02b.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <p>
    Simpler versions of these are also available, which only contain one power outlet and no pass-through for lamps,
    which are much smaller and could be useful for temporary use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notably, both of these adaptors have a very limited rating (max 660W), understandably so since lamp sockets aren't
    generally designed to handle large amounts of current, although as there is no fuse or breaker to actually enforce
    this it's up to the user to be careful with their use.

  <!-- Old power sockets paragraph:
  <p>
    American electrics have always been fascinating to me, partly because of how varied they are and partly because
    they're so different from what I'm used to.
  </p>
  <p>
    Discussion of American electrical items seems to primarily focus on their safety, or lack thereof, and for good
    reasons, but in this page I'd also like to compare some of their other features with their European counterparts,
    and also try to describe, if possible, their feel and in general the different vibe I get from them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course in general when comparing the two different systems people tend to defend what they're used to (you'll
    see this in electrical discussions quite often) - I'm guilty of that as well, and to be fair my view of
    American electrics is somewhat negative, but I think there are certainly some positive aspects found there which
    I hope I can document adequately.
  </p>

  <h3>Power outlets</h3>
  <h4>North American 15A and 20A power sockets</h4>
  <a href="images/foreign/american/outlet_01a.jpg"><img src="images/foreign/american/outlet_01a.jpg" height=140></a>
  <a href="images/foreign/american/outlet_01b.jpg"><img src="images/foreign/american/outlet_01b.jpg" height=140></a>
  <a href="images/foreign/american/outlet_01c.jpg"><img src="images/foreign/american/outlet_01c.jpg" height=140></a>
  <p>
    These are some standard North American 15A and 20A sockets - the 20A being made by Leviton and the 15A by Cooper.
    Of course the shape of the sockets is completely different from the European types, that's obvious, but the
    interesting thing is how different these sockets are built compared to the Italian ones, which is what I'm used to.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's start by looking at the front cover plate: the decorative plate on the American outlets mounts with one or more
    screws (depending on the style of the socket - in this case it's just one screw) to the device itself, though there
    are also some clip-on covers that you can buy instead that hide the screws, and it's the only thing separating you
    from the live connections inside.
    The cover plates can actually vary depending on what device you're mounting, which means that if you want to change
    the device (for example, if you need a second lightswitch) you might have to buy a new cover plate as well.
  </p>
  <a href="images/foreign/american/outlet_01d.jpg"><img src="images/foreign/american/outlet_01d.jpg" height=140></a>
  <a href="images/foreign/american/outlet_01e.jpg"><img src="images/foreign/american/outlet_01e.jpg" height=140></a>
  <p>
    Connecting the wires can be done using two methods, depending on the type of the socket. The 15A one allows you to
    connect them using "push-in" slots on the rear, however I've heard a lot of complaints about this method of
    installation and in fact the 20A one lacks this option entirely.
    <br>
    The best method is to use the screws on the side: the wire goes around them and is then tightened by the screw.
    The screws also have a little metal connection that can be removed in case you want to wire up the two sockets to
    different circuits (for example, you could leave the top one always on while the other one could be controlled by a
    lightswitch).
    <br>
    Other, more expensive, sockets use instead a rising clamp terminal, which is a better connection method.
    This is how the sockets I've used are wired up (though I don't know if it's common across all brands).
  </p>
  <p>
    The way these kinds of outlets mount is pretty interesting: they use a metal piece built into the device itself,
    which contains holes for the screws that are used to mount the outlet into the wall box.
    In contrast, the Italian sockets don't screw into the wall box directly, instead they're modules that clip onto a
    support bracket, generally made of plastic, which is then what screws into the wall.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is, in my opinion, the most important difference between the two systems: the Italian way of using modular
    devices (which I can only imagine became popular due to the number of various sockets we have) is actually not
    all that common in other countries, the US included (I know there are some systems there that try to replicate
    the same concept, but they're not common).
    The lack of modularity in North American devices does make them less flexible, however it's not a big problem in
    most cases, and it might even make installing them easier.
  </p>
  <a href="images/foreign/us_03a.jpg"><img src="images/foreign/us_03a.jpg" height=140></a>
  <p>
    Lastly, it's interesting to note that the North American devices can mount in a standard Italian 503 box (which
    is the most common size).
    This is because the modern Italian wall box was actually derived from the American standard (before that the boxes
    that were used were circular).
