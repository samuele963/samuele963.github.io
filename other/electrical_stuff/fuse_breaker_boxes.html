  <h2>Vintage Italian fuse and breaker panels</h2>
  <p>
    Here's the thing: Italy didn't have fuse panels, at least not in the same way as other countries did.
    Of course, it's not like Italy didn't have fuses at all, however we didn't have something ready-made like
    the Wylex fuse boxes in the UK and the Edison screw fuse panels in the US, or even some of the self-contained
    Diazed fuses boards used in parts of Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    This meant that the way protection for the various circuits was achieved here was to buy separate fuse holders
    for each circuit - which wouldn't been as big of a deal back then as houses often had very few of them anyways -
    and then mount them to a board or some sort of electrical enclosure.
  </p>

  <h3>Fuse holders</h3>
  <p><img src="images/foreign/diazed_01b.jpg" height="105" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    Fuse holders can vary a lot between different designs, but all of them fall into one of two categories: they can
    either be cartridge-based, or rewireable.
    <br>
    The advantage of the rewireable ones was the cost, you could buy cards with fuse wire that would last
    you for quite a while, however they did require a bit more skill to install (compared to removing a cartridge
    fuse and putting another one in), and it made it easier to use the wrong size of fuse compared to some of the
    cartridge designs, like the <a href="foreign_stuff_european.html#diazed">Diazed fuses</a> (which, while standard
    in the rest of Europe, weren't as common for residential installations in Italy).
  </p>
  <p>
    The main disadvantage of fuses was that they're not resettable. Breakers did eventually catch on, of
    course, but given their much higher complexity (compared to fuses, which are just a wire that melts with a fancy
    case around it, essentially) they were out of the price range of most people for decades after their introduction.
  </p>

  <h4>"Tobacco tin" rewireable fuse holder</h4>
  <p>
    The so-called "portafusibile a tabacchiera", tobacco tin fuse holders, were among the most popular types of
    fuse holders in use in Italy up until the 50s-60s.
    They consisted of a ceramic piece with metal contacts, with screws to attach the wires, and a removable lid (also
    made of ceramic) which is where the fuse wire was held.
  </p>
  <p>
    This particular example is in remarkably good condition. Normally with ceramic stuff it's quite common to
    see scratches or chips, as they're quite fragile, but this one is almost perfect - and it's fairly clean as well.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_07a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_07a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_07b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_07b.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <h4>Edison socket cartridge-style fuses</h4>
  <p>
    These are early examples of cartridge-based fuses; they were built out of metal with ceramic as an insulator,
    with the metal, oddly enough, also being used for an insulated piece on the top where the user was meant to
    unscrew the fuse.
    <br>
    The fuse holder was built out of a single piece of ceramic and used normal E27 sockets (two, in this case) -
    this meant that replacing the fuse was as easy as changing a lightbulb.
  </p>
  <p>
    The top also features the screws for the wire connections - the contacts are on a slight recess, but they are
    still very easy to touch, which means the user would have had to pay special attention when replacing a fuse.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_08a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_08a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_08b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_08b.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <p><a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_08c.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_08c.jpg" height="75" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;"></a>
    This style of fuse holder is somewhat similar to the ones once used in North America, since those also used
    Edison screw sockets, and in fact an American fuse fits perfectly. Those types of fuses generally used a glass top
    rather than a metal one, so they'd actually have been somewhat safer than the original fuses that came with this
    holder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notably, compared to other designs that have some sort of lid, like the Diazed fuses but also ones used here in
    Italy, in this one there is no lid or any other pieces other than the fuse itself, which screws directly into
    the Edison socket.
  </p>

  <h4>BTicino 642 rewireable fuse holder</h4>
  <p></p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_12a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_12a.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <h3>Breakers</h3>
  <h4>AVE type 1902 double pole breaker</h4>
  <p>
    This is a type of early breaker. Like most other early breakers, it's quite large and it's built on a ceramic
    base, with a plastic cover on top of it.
    This specific example is missing the top and bottom covers that would have protected the terminals - this is also
    where some of the mounting holes are situated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The screws holding the cover in place have holes so they could be sealed if the usecase required it - for example,
    if the breaker was to be used as a limiter by a power company.
    Once the cover is removed the mechanism is revealed, including the two large coils which sense a possible
    overcurrent or short circuit.
    <br>
    Adjustment of the tripping current can be done here, using a rotating wheel. Indeed, contrary to most modern
    household breakers, these old ones had a user-adjustable current.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_06a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_06a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_06b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_06b.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_06c.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_06c.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <p>
    The front cover contains the on/off buttons (instead of a lever like on modern devices), which are surrounded by
    a protrusion to prevent accidentally pushing them, and a label with the model number, manufacturer's name, and
    rating. The breaker is rated at 380V, 12 to 25A (as also indicated on the adjustment wheel).
  </p>

  <h4>BTicino double pole breaker</h4>
  <p>
    BTicino breakers were some of the most popular types of early breakers in use in Italy.
    Like the AVE one, turning the power on or off is done with two large buttons on the front, which make a satisfying
    clack when pushed.
  </p>
  <p>
    A label on the top is present, with the trip current (9A) written on it, which can also be seen from a window
    present in the front cover. The label also proudly boasts the high breaking current of the breaker, and that its
    contacts are made of a special metal composition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notably, unlike the AVE breaker or the BTicino single-pole one shown later, this one does not permit the user to
    adjust its trip current - the controls to adjust it are likely there but they are under a sealed plastic cover -
    breaking the seal likely voided the warranty of the device, and any guarantee of protection.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_05a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_05a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_05b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_05b.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_05c.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_05c.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <h4>BTicino type 1601 single pole breaker</h4>
  <p>
    This style of breaker, with a gray plastic front cover, was much more common than the one seen earlier.
    Notably, this is a single pole breaker, so likely used in installations on a 220/380V transformer to break the
    line connection only.
  </p>
  <p>
    A control dial is present next to the output connection in order to set the trip current of the device.
    There is also the same label as seen on the previous one, but without an amp rating written on it, since this
    would have been set by the user (this could be set between 5 and 25A).
  </p>
  <p>
    Wiring was possible either from the back or from the top or bottom of the device, by removing two clear plastic
    inserts present in the front cover.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_07a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_07a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_07b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_07b.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_07c.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_07c.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <h4>AVE "PIM" breaker</h4>
  <p>
    As technology progressed, the size of breakers became smaller and smaller. This is evident with this breaker,
    which, while definitely not as small as the DIN rail ones that became common later, is substantially smaller than
    the ones shown earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is rated at 16A 380V, and looks quite similar to the DIN rail breakers (apart from the size and not actually
    using a DIN rail) - the front lever is the same style used even nowadays, and the trip current isn't
    user-adjustable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name of this type of breaker - manufactured by AVE - is written into the plastic on the side: PIM, which
    stands for "Small Magneto-thermal breaker"; evidently the significant size difference compared to older models
    was a big selling point.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_08a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_08a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_08b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_08b.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_08c.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_08c.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <h4>Siemens DIN rail breaker</h4>
  <p>
    This is an early style of DIN rail breaker used here. Not much is different from modern ones, apart from the
    styling being obviously older, but there are still some other minor differences.<br>
    It's rated at 16A 250V, and is of the now no longer in use type "L". This is a double pole breaker, with
    connections to both line and neutral, as is common in Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of note is the style of screw terminals, which are substantially different than the ones used in modern devices,
    with a large amount of exposed metal.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_09a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_09a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_09b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_09b.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <h3>Residual current devices (RCDs)</h3>
  <h4>AVE early RCD breaker</h4>
  <p>
    This early style of RCD is from the same lineup as the "PIM" breaker shown earlier, and is made up of a 25A breaker
    the same size as the other one combined with an RCD module (which most of the space inside of is occupied by a
    large current-sensing transformer), all enclosed under one unit.<br>
    The RCD is actually so early it calls itself an ELCB, an Earth Leakcage Circuit Breaker, which is a term generally
    no longer used nowadays.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the front there's a label, the main on/off switch, the usual test button and a sensitivity control, which
    can be turned in two directions to set the trip current either to 30 or 300mA and which is held in the most
    sensitive position by a seal.
  </p>
  <p>
    A diagram is present on a label on the top, showing how the device works internally; on the back there's also an
    add-on plastic bracket meant to hold the device onto a DIN rail. The bracket is quite small compared to the size
    of the device and is only on one side, which means that, while it does technnically mount on a DIN rail, it feels
    like it's going to fall off at any time.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/rcd_01a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/rcd_01a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/rcd_01b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/rcd_01b.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <h3>Panels</h3>
  <h4>Fuse panel with BTicino fuses</h4>
  <p><img src="images/vintage/fusebox_01a.jpg" height="125" style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    This fusebox was made by taking an ordinary electrical enclosure and mounting two BTicino fuse holders on it, a
    common practice at the time.
    The two fuse holders are double-pole 16A-rated models made by BTicino, who sold tons of models similar to this
    over the years.
    <br>
    The double pole fusing might seem strange, however back in the day it wasn't uncommon to have both wires coming
    into your home be live at 120V (even after the 120V lighting circuit were faded out), and in some rare cases
    that is still a thing in Italy (although in most installations it has been phased out a long time ago).
  </p>
  <p>
    The box the fuse holders are mounted on is made of metal, with the lid the breakers sit on being made out of some
    kind of wood.
    The box has no place for an earth connection, which isn't surprising given that back in the day earthing wasn't
    very common in Italian homes, and safety practices were lacking.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_06a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_06a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_06b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_06b.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_06c.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_06c.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <!-- <a href=""><img src="" height="140"></a> -->
  <p>
    The fuse holders are made of ceramic, with a plastic moulded lid on top of them.
    The two fuses are of a cartridge type, and they are removed by unscrewing the two small covers on the front of
    the device.
    The lids have a slot in them so you can use a coin to unscrew them, and they also have a clear window so you can
    tell when the fuse has blown.
  </p>
  <p>
    A switch is present so you can remove the fuses safely (although there is nothing stopping you from removing the
    fuses with the power still on).
    <br>
    The switch has a coloured indicator to inform the user of its state - red for on and green for off.
    This might seem counterintuitive, however the idea is that green = safe, and red = dangerous.
    This practice is present even on some modern breakers.
  </p>

  <h3>History</h3>
  <h4>A look at the history of fuses</h4>
  <p>
    In the early days of electricity being available, there wasn't really a single standard for fuses.
    Early fuse holders, generally made of ceramic or bakelite, were made in all sorts of shapes and sizes.
    They were available as both cartridges and rewireable fuses; the latter being more common.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fuse holders meant for use with rewireable fuse wire could vary quite considerably in design.
    The most popular variant was the "portafusibile a tabacchiera" (tobacco tin fuse holder), which had a ceramic
    lid on which the fuse wire was held, however other designs were also available.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_01.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_01.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_02.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_02.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_04.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_04.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <p>
    Cartridge fuse holders also varied considerably in design, with some models having the fuse screw down onto an
    Edison-style screw socket, while others had a lid which you had to unscrew to replace the fuse.
    Some versions also had a window to show when the fuse had blown, in order to find it more easily inside a fusebox.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_05.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_05.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_09.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_09.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_10.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_10.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <p>
    Of course, all of these early examples were incredibly unsafe, with metal terminals exposed and easy to touch.
    I explored that in more detail in the section about <a href="safety.html">safety</a>.
  </p>

  <p><img src="images/fuseboxes/fuseholder_06a.jpg" height=140 style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    During the last decades of the fuse era, one specific brand became popular: BTicino. BTicino fuse holders had been
    available in the 50s and earlier, but they surged in popularity during the 60s, and 70, being used from isolators
    for boilers to apartment fuse panels.
    <br>
    These types of fuse holder were available in a wide variety of models, but they can basically be grouped into two
    main varieties: the cartridge fuse ones and the rewireable fuse ones.
    The various models that were available differed in rating (16A, 26A and 50A), number of fuses (one, two or three,
    depending on the type of circuit) and mounting options (panel mount vs surface mount) and materials (metal or plastic).
  </p>
  <p>
    One specific type of devices that I would like to focus on were the "interruttori antinfortunistici" (="switches
    for protection against accidents").
    <br>
    These were fuse holders, made of metal, which had a lid on top of the fuses to prevent you from removing them unless
    the power switch was in the off position.
    Many of them also had a plug which you could remove, again only once the power switch was turned off, a feature which I presume would have been very useful in industrial applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing you might have noticed with all of these fuse holders is that most of them contain two fuses.
    <br>
    This isn't because they were meant for two circuits , it's because they were meant for two-phase 220V or 280V
    circuits, with lighting circuits only using one phase and thus only needing single-pole fuse holders.
    I talked about that in more detail in the <a href="history.html">history section</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>The history of breakers</h4>
  <p><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_01.jpg" height="95" style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    The earliest breakers to become popular were the Zeus-Rapizzi type.
    <br>
    Being so early, they were initally not common in normal houses, instead being used in commercial applications
    or, apparently, as limiters for power companies.
    The Zeus breakers had a fairly modern appearance, since they had a normal switch to turn the power on or off
    instead of using push-buttons like most other early breaker models.
  </p>

  <p><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_04.jpg" height="95" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    Later on BTicino started producing breakers too - BTicino breakers were very popular in the 60s, and there were
    various types of them: some mounted on a board like normal fuse holders, but there was another type that was
    wall-mounted and came with two breakers, depending on the configuration.
    <br>
    From my understanding this was the first breaker panel to become popular, however it wasn't modular: you could
    buy various configurations of it (apparently one of the configurations came with a built-in doorbell transformer),
    but you couldn't add other breakers after the fact.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One way of building modular panels was with a system made by Ave. This system consisted of various modules that
    could be connected together to form a single panel.
    This might seem like the same thing as a modern panel, but from the looks of it modules couldn't be added afterwards
    since it seems like this system was meant to be mounted inside the wall.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_03a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_03a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_03b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_03b.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <p>
    The earliest "real" breaker panel that I could find a pic of is the "TIMATIC" line from BTicino, which was
    briefly described in an electrical book from the 60s I have.
    Thing is, if you go online and search for it, you'll find zero results. However, I've seen some eBay listings
    of breakers that looked a LOT like the ones in that picture, except they were branded as "MagiTik"...
    but I've never managed to see a picture of a breaker panel like the one in that book.
    <br>
    Being that there's literally 0 info about this line online, I can't imagine that it was all that popular.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_02a.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_02a.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <a href="images/fuseboxes/breaker_02b.jpg"><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_02b.jpg" height="140"></a>

  <p>
    So, this means that the earliest modular, modern-style type of breaker panel that I've seen online is the BTicino
    Tiker system. This was basically an Italian DIN rail: you had various modules that you could connect in a box,
    and you could get boxes of various sizes depending on your needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, later on DIN rail breakers and RCDs as used anywhere in Europe were adopted.
    There isn't much to differentiate the earlier ones from modern examples other than the design (modern ones
    generally have more plastic around the terminals to prevent accidental contacts).
    <br>
    Notably, breakers today still break the neutral as well as the live, perhaps a leftover from the days of dual
    fusing.
