  <h2>Vintage Italian fuse and breaker panels</h2>
  <p>
    Here's the thing: Italy didn't have fuse panels, at least not in the same way as other countries did.
    Now, it's not like Italy didn't have fuses at all of course, the thing is, we didn't have something ready-made like
    the Wylex fuse boxes in the UK and the Edison screw fuse panels in the US.
    <br>
    What people did was they bought separate fuse holders for each circuit - then they were all mounted to a board or
    some kind of electrical enclosure.

    This fusebox was made by taking an ordinary electrical enclosure and mounting two BTicino fuse holders on it.

  <h4>Other types of fuses</h4>

  <p>
    In the early days of electricity being available, there wasn't really a single standard for fuses.
    Early fuse holders, generally made of ceramic or bakelite, were made in all sorts of shapes and sizes.
    They were available as both cartridges and rewireable fuses; the latter being more common.
    <br>
    One very popular type of fuse holder was the "portafusibile a tabacchiera" (literally, "tobacco tin fusebox").
    It consisted of a ceramic box which held the screw terminals for the wires, and a lid which carried the fuse wire itself.
    <br>
    As for cartridge fuse holders, they generally had some kind of round lid which you had to unscrew to replace the fuse,
    which in some models also contained a window to let you see which fuse had blown.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the last decades of the fuse era, one specific brand became popular: BTicino. BTicino fuse holders had been
    available in the 50s and earlier, but they surged in popularity during the 60s, and 70, being used from isolators
    for boilers to apartment fuse panels.
    These types of fuse holder were available in a wide variety of models, but they can basically be grouped into two
    main varieties: the cartridge fuse ones and the rewireable fuse ones.
    The various models that were available differed in rating (16A, 26A and 50A), number of fuses (one, two or three,
    depending on the type of circuit) and mounting options (panel mount vs surface mount) and materials (metal or plastic).
  </p>
  <p>
    One specific type of devices that I would like to focus on were the "interruttori antinfortunistici" (="switches
    for protection against accidents").
    <br>
    These were fuse holders, made of metal, which had a lid on top of the fuses to prevent you from removing them unless
    the power switch was in the off position.
    Many of them also had a plug which you could remove, again only once the power switch was turned off, a feature which I presume would have been very useful in industrial applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing you might have noticed with all of these fuse holders is that most of them contain two fuses.
    <br>
    This isn't because they were meant for two circuits (though I presume you could have probably used them that way
    if you really wanted to), it's because they were meant for two-phase 220V or 280V circuits, with lighting circuits
    only using one phase and thus only needing single-pole fuse holders.

  <h3>Breakers</h3>
  <p><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_01.jpg" height="95" style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    The earliest breakers to become popular were the Zeus-Rapizzi type.
    <br>
    Being so early, they were initally not common in normal houses, instead being used in commercial applications
    or, apparently, as limiters for power companies.
    The Zeus breakers had a fairly modern appearance, since they had a normal switch to turn the power on or off
    instead of using push-buttons like some other examples.
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/fuseboxes/breaker_04.jpg" height="95" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 6px;">
    Later on BTicino started producing breakers too - BTicino breakers were very popular in the 60s, and there were
    various types of them: some mounted on a board like normal fuse holders, but there was another type that was
    wall-mounted and came with two breakers, depending on the configuration.
    <br>
    From my understanding this was the first breaker panel to become popular, however it wasn't modular: you could
    buy various configurations of it (apparently one of the configurations came with a built-in doorbell transformer),
    but you couldn't add other breakers after the fact.
  </p>

  <p>
    One way of building modular panels was with a system made by Ave. This system consisted of various modules that
    could be connected together to form a single panel.
    This might seem like the same thing as a modern panel, but from the looks of it modules couldn't be added afterwards
    since it seems like this system was meant to be mounted inside the wall.
  </p>

  <p>
    The earliest "real" breaker panel that I could find a pic of is the "TIMATIC" line from BTicino, which was
    briefly described in an electrical book from the 60s I have.
    Thing is, if you go online and search for it, you'll find zero results. However, I've seen some eBay listings
    of breakers that looked a LOT like the ones in that picture, except they were branded as "MagiTik"...
    but I've never managed to see a picture of a breaker panel like the one in that book.
    <br>
    Being that there's literally 0 info about this line online, I can't imagine that it was all that popular.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, this means that the earliest modular, modern-style type of breaker panel that I've seen online is the BTicino
    Tiker system. This was basically an Italian DIN rail: you had various modules that you could connect in a box,
    and you could get boxes of various sizes depending on your needs.
