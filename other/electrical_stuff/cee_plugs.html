  <h2>Types of plugs and sockets found in Europe</h2>
  <p>
    Electrical codes across the various European countries often evolved separately, with different local variations.
    As such, it's impressive that nowadays, aside from a few specific cases, most Continental European countries have
    adopted the same standard for plugs, which work in either of the two styles most commonly used.

  <h3>CEE 7/7 and 7/16 plugs</h3>

  <h3>Classical German-style ("Schuko") and French-style power plugs</h3>
  <p></p>

  <h3>CEE 7/17 ("Contour plug")</h3>
  <p></p>

  <h3>Other types of plug and socket standards</h3>
  <p>
    While the CEE standard plugs and sockets are used in the majority of Europe, there are some countries that,
    generally for historical reasons, use different standards (either partially or entirely):

    <b>1. Italy</b> –
    In Italy a different style of plugs and sockets is used, with non-polarised 10A and 16A plugs and sockets.
    However, more recently, newly-built or renovated houses are starting to feature sockets compatible with Schuko
    plugs as well as Italian ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>2. Switzerland</b> –
    Swiss uses polarised 10A (and, rarely, 16A) plugs and sockets with an hexagonal shape (similar to the Europlug).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>3. Denmark</b> –
    Danish sockets are compatible with CEE plugs of any type, however due to their plugs using an earth pin, any earthed
    CEE plug won't have an earth connection when plugged into one of these sockets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that in all of these countries the Europlug is used extensively, and in Denmark and Italy also the CEE 7/7
    and 7/17, though in Italy an adaptor is often required to connect those two to most sockets.
