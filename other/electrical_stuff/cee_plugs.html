  <h2>Types of plugs and sockets found in Europe</h2>
  <p>
    Electrical codes across the various European countries often evolved separately, with different local variations.
    As such, it's impressive that nowadays, aside from a few specific cases, most Continental European countries have
    adopted the same standard for plugs and sockets.

  <h3>Schuko and French-style plugs and sockets</h3>

  <h3>CEE 7/7</h3>
  <p>
    These plugs are compatible with both Schuko and French-style power sockets.
  </p>

  <h3>CEE 7/16 Alternative II (Europlug)</h3>
  <p>
    Likely the most commonly used plug in Europe, the Europlug was designed to be compatible with any socket througout
    the Continent.
  </p>

  <h3>CEE 7/17</h3>
  <p></p>

  <h3>Other types of plug and socket standards</h3>
  <p>
    While the CEE standard plugs and sockets are used in the majority of Europe, there are some countries that,
    generally for historical reasons, use different standards:

  <p>
    <b>1. Italy</b> –
    In Italy a different style of plugs and sockets is used, with non-polarised 10A and 16A plugs and sockets.
    However, more recently, newly-built or renovated houses are starting to feature sockets compatible with Schuko
    plugs as well as Italian ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>2. Switzerland</b> –
    Swiss uses polarised 10A (and, rarely, 16A) plugs and sockets with an hexagonal shape (similar to the Europlug).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>3. Denmark</b> <i>(items are not present in the collection unfortunately)</i> –
    Danish sockets are compatible with CEE plugs of any type, however due to their plugs using an earth pin, any earthed
    CEE plug won't have an earth connection when plugged into one of these sockets.
