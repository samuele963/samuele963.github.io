  <h2>Other devices and unusual items</h2>
  <p>
    This page contains the items in my collection that don't really fit anywhere else.
  </p>

  <h3>German radio antenna connector</h3>
  <p>
    This socket from Germany is meant to be connected to an antenna and used with a radio, as written on the device
    itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The connector is polarised (with the positive and negative holes labelled up on the front cover); two screws on
    the front remove the faceplate which then also reveals the connections and screw holes for mounting to a wallbox.

  <h3>DIN rail lightswitch</h3>
  <p>
    The flexibility of the DIN rail means that it can be used for many things other than just breakers - this, for
    example, is a lightswitch meant to fit on one. This can be useful for controlling lights in a more industrial or
    specialised usecase, such as a bank of lights with a main breaker next to them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lightswitch inside is simply a module, made by Vimar - it's possible to have things other than a lightswitch
    installed, such as a power socket, depending on the usecase. This way the flexibility of modular electrical devices
    can be combined with the one present in the DIN rail system.

  <h3>AEG mains-powered hour meter</h3>
  <p>
    This is a fairly simple hour meter - once powered up, by mains voltage, it counts the hours that it's been powered
    up for. This is useful for machinery or equipment that may need something to happen after a certain point, like
    servicing or replacement of components.
