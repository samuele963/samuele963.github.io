  <h3>Rewireable plugs and sockets</h3>
  <h4>Round bakelite plug</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 10A 250V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an old plug that was connected to a tube radio from the 50s (it was probably the plug that originally came
    with that radio). It has since been replaced with something more modern (and much safer!), but I kept it for my
    collection because it's fairly interesting to look at, the design and shape of it is completely different from the
    more modern plugs you can buy today.

  <h4>Old bakelite plug</h4>

    This was also connected to an old tube radio. It was probably made in the 50s.
    This plug is made out of two idential pieces of brown bakelite, and it is then held closed with a screw and a nut.
    I presume this was a cost-cutting measure so they only had to make one mould instead of two.

  <h4>Round 16A type-L plug </h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 16A 250V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an old 16A type L plug I found on an old extension cord.
    There are two interesting things about it: the first thing is the shape of it, it's definitely very unusual, and it
    makes the plug take up a lot of space.
    The second thing is the fact that the earth pin on it is longer than the other pins - a safety feature which means that
    the device will be earthed before it is powered on.
    <br>
    This is a feature sometimes found in plugs from other countries, but it's not a common thing with Italian plugs,
    as you can see in the second picture, so it's definitely unusual that this one has it.

  <h4>Round type-L socket</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 15A 380V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a "big" type-L socket, with dimensions similar to the round plug previously mentioned.
    It has a small indentation on the outside, presumably to help reduce the risk of accidental contacts (this wouldn't
    help completely, and especially with smaller plugs, but it's better than nothing), a feature some sockets at the time
    had, before shuttered sockets became common.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rating of 380V is interesting - generally at the time these sockets would have been used at 220V, which could have
    either come from two phases from a 127/220V transformer, or a phase and neutral from a 220/380V transformer, but the
    380V rating implies that this could have been used with <b>two phases</b> from the a 220/380V transformer, something
    I'm not sure was ever all that popular (I presume a three phase plug would have been more suitable instead, especially
    to prevent connecting the wrong type of device to the socket).

  <h4>Rewireable plugs and sockets by BTicino</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 15A, 15A, 10A 250V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    These rewireable plugs were made by the Italian company BTicino and are definitely interesting for their lack of safety
    features compared to more modern plugs (although that's not surprising given their age).
  </p>
  <p>
    The first plug is a 2-prong (so, with no earth connection) 16A plug, with no safety sleeving - this makes it extremely
    easy for someone to accidentally touch the live pins while the plug is half-way into a socket.
    <br>
    The two sockets (one is a 16A and the other is a 10A), on the other hand, lack protective shutters, which means that
    you can easily place a metal object in the live pins and that you can also do dangerous things like connecting the earth
    pin of an appliance into the live pins of the socket.
    <br>
    Additionally, the contacts inside of them are almost right on the surface of the socket, which means that the pins
    of a plug become live as soon as you've started to insert it into the socket - and if you use one of the plugs
    without safety sleeving then you can leave the majority of the surface of the pins live for you to touch.
    Definitely not great!

  <h4>BTicino Magic rewireable plug and socket</h4>
  <p>
    <i>
      Rating: 10A 250V
      <br>
      See also: <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/" title="Of course I linked to the XKCD comic, why wouldn't I?" target="_blank">Standards</a>
    </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is probably <b>the</b> weirdest type of plug I have ever seen.
    <br>
    It was designed entirely around safety: the socket had a complex shutter mechanism that meant that nothing but
    the right plug could open it. The plug was polarised and didn't make contact with the socket until it was well
    within the socket itelf.
    Because of this any accidental contacts with live parts were essentially impossible.
    <br>
    And all of this in the 60s, at a time where the normal Italian plug were considerably less safe than they are
    nowadays.
  </p>
  <p>
    So why did they fail?
    <br>
    Well, it turns out that making an entirely new standard of plugs and convincing everyone to switch over from
    the previous one is harder than you might imagine.
    <br>
    As far as I'm aware there weren't any appliances that came with Magic plugs already on them, so the users had
    to buy new ones to fit their devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    But that wasn't the only reason: although these plugs were incerdibly safe for the time, the standard Italian
    plugs and sockets also adopted some <a href="safety.html">safety features</a>, some (like the shutters) inspired by features found in the
    Magic plug standard.
    <br>
    Additionally, their additional safety meant that installing Magic sockets in your house was considerably more
    expensive than using standard ones.
    Therefore these outlets were generally only seen in specialised environments or in higher end electrical
    installations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thankfully if you found yourself in a house with Magic sockets, they sold adaptors to convert them to a standard
    Italian socket! Which... defeated the entire point of having them in the first place.

  <h4>BTicino Magic 16A rewireable socket</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 16A 250V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a rewireable Magic socket, something you could have used when building an extension cord, for example.
    This seems to be a fairly uncommon item, which makes sense since not a lot of people could have made use
    of these.
    <br>
    Interestingly enough, this socket only accepts 16A plugs, it does not accept the 10A plug shown previously.
    From my understanding, later 16A sockets <b>did</b> accept 10A plugs, but this must be an earlier model where
    that was not the case.
  </p>

  <a href="images/magicplugs/magic_02c.jpg"><img src="images/magicplugs/magic_02c.jpg" height="140"></a>
  <p>
    Once you open it up it is revealed that, in fact, this is just a standard 16A Magic socket module inside a
    plastic enclosure.
    I guess this probably made sense from a manufacturing perspectiv, but it is still funny to see.

  <h4>White sockets with indentation</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 10A 250V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    These are two type L sockets, one of the "big" type and the other one is the "small" type. Both are, however,
    rated at 10A.
    There's nothing incredibly special about these sockets: they're made of some kind of flexible rubber, and they
    both have a protective part around the entrance of the pins - presumably to protect the user from accidentally
    touching the pins of the plug. This also means that not all plugs will fit these sockets, which is quite
    annoying.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bigger socket has some weird square holes, which is the reason why I got it for my collection.
    However, that is just the shape of the plastic moulding. The actual contacts inside are rounded like you'd
    expect. They also don't seem to hold onto the plug very well - this socket probably was made assuming that
    the plug would be the one holding onto the socket, instead of the opposite - while this isn't a thing anymore,
    it was a common arrangement at the time.

  <h3>Three-phase plugs and sockets</h3>
  <h4>3-pin and 4-pin plugs and sockets</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 15A 380V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    Although in Italy three-phase power isn't commonly found in the home (unless you request it specifically), the
    electrical distribution is of course three phase, and most businesses and factories do have all three phases
    available.
    <br>
    So, it makes sense that there are plugs made specifically for connecting devices that need 3 phase power, and these
    are what were used in Italy before the current CEE plugs were available.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first plug (and socket) only has 3 pins, for the 3 phases, but the second one also has a pin in the center for the
    earth connection. Although the un-earthed socket might seem to have a hole for an earth pin, that is simply the hole
    used to take the screw out, when disassembling the plug. However, it is still deep enough to let a 4-pin plug make
    connection, at least partially.
    <br>
    Both types of plugs don't have a neutral connection: because of this, these plugs could have only been used with
    balanced loads like motors.

  <h4>30A 4-pin plug</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 30A 380V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This plug is clearly just a larger version of the ones above, being rated for 30A instead of 15.
    The design is identical to the ones above, just at a larger scale, and additionally the central earth pin is
    noticeably larger than the live pins around it, a feature not present in the 15A version.
  </p>
  <p>
    This particular example has never been used - apart from the distinct cleanliness of it, this can also be
    confirmed by the place on the body of the plug where the cord would have gone not having been perforated.
    It's certainly a fascinating way of installing a plug which I have never seen before.

  <h3>Adaptors and other things</h3>
  <h4>Light socket adaptor</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: unknown</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    These devices were commonly used to connect appliances to a lamp socket, before sockets in houses were common.
    In Italy they were colloquially called <i>rubacorrente</i> (current stealer), as they were also used to run
    appliances from the (cheaper) lighting supply.
    Most of them, like this one, had two sockets (with no earth connection, of course) and one pass-through Edison
    lamp socket so you could still connect a lightbulb.

  <h4>Early style of multiway adaptor</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: unknown</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    Adaptors with this type of design were very common, and very distinctive due to their shape.
    They feature three "small" type L sockets, with the earth hole present, with the plastic moulding shaped
    exactly around the shape of the holes on the sockets.
    This particular adaptor doesn't feeature an earth pin (and it wasn't cut off either, this adaptor was sold
    like this) - these were sold when almost all houses didn't have earthing, so it'd have likely also been used
    to bypass the earth pin on an appliance as well.

    <i>Rating: 10A 250V - but also only 1000W maximum</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an old multiway adaptor, it has 1 16A type-L socket and 2 10A ones. The 16A socket doesn't support 10A plugs,
    and there are no shutters on the holes on any of the sockets, however the pins on it are sleeved for safety - it's
    interesting to see how some of the safety features present in modern plugs are present, but others are missing.

  <h4>Magic to Bipasso adaptor</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Rating: 10/16A 250V</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you bought into the BTicino Magic sockets you might have wanted to connect some appliances without rewiring
    every one of them (something impossible to do with power bricks, for example).
    <br>
    Thankfully adaptors like this one existed, to let you connect normal Italian plugs to a Magic outlet - of course,
    this defeated the safety benefits of the Magic system, which was likely the entire reason why they were installed
    in the first place, althogh to be fair this seems to be a fairly safe adaptor, with shutters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notably, this adaptor works both in 10A and 16A Magic sockets - even the 16A-only socket I have.
    This makes sense, as it would have made this adaptor work with basically any Magic socket in a house.
