  <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
  <p>The website is in perpetual work-in-progress, so please excuse the mess.</p>
  <p>Over here I'll post about some of my projects and interests - I'm also working on a guide to help Linux newcomers get started with their new OS. Right now the website is still being worked on, so there's not much here to look at - however I hope to add more stuff here.</p>
  <p>If you've found this website useful, you should check out my Twitter and YouTube pages!</p>
