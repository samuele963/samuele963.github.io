  <h2>Wiring and power distribution</h2>
  <p>
    Wiring practices vary considerably between different countries, even within Europe. This page covers some of these
    differences, both on how power is distributed to an installation, as well as how wiring is done inside the
    installation itself.
  </p>

  <h3>Earthing systems</h3>
  <p>
    As mentioned <a href="">previously</a>, the protective earth (ground) is a crucial safety feature in an electrical
    installation, and thus mandatory in most countries around the world.
    However, the actual way an earthing system works can vary substantially, not just between different nations but
    even within the same country, with each system having a different set of pros and cons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Classification of the different types of earthing arrangements is generally done using terminology set by the
    International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC); these are generally divided into three categories: TN, TT and IT.
    TN supplies (that is, ones where the neutral is physically connected to the earth conductor at some point) are then
    subsequently divided into more categories to specify the point at which this connection is made.

  <h4>TN-S supplies</h4>

  <h4>TN-C supplies</h4>

  <h4>TN-C-S supplies</h4>

  <h4>IT (isolated) supplies</h4>
  <p>
    In these supplies none of the connections on the transformer are connected to earth at any point.
    This means that, in normal conditions, it's impossible to get an electric shock by touching just one wire.
    Because of this safety benefit, these supplies are often used in special situations such as in hospitals, to power
    critical machinery.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of IT supplies is also common in Norway, generally on a 127/220V transformer. This was traditionally
    considered safer, however an isolated system has the problem of being nearly impossible to keep isolated when
    many appliances are connected.
    This, combined with some devices not powering on at all under an IT system, has lead Norway to slowly migrate to
    TN-C-S like other European countries.

  <h3>Standard European wall boxes</h3>
  <p>
    The vast majority of countries in Europe use round boxes, which the device is then fixed to either using screws or
    (in older houses) using metal tabs present on the device which push onto the sides of the box.
  </p>
  <p>
    A standard wall-box is only capable of holding one <a href="">Schuko</a> (or French-style) power socket;
    however, larger boxes are available which allow for installing more than one device.
    Installing devices in these boxes is fairly simple, with each device being installed the same way as in a standard
    box and then the appropriate cover plate being fitted on top.
  </p>
  <p>
    The box shown here is a surface-mount type, in this case used on a wooden board to test power meters (hence the
    single insulated wiring - obviously this wouldn't be allowed in an actual electrical installation).
