  <h2>Wiring and power distribution</h2>
  <p>
    Wiring practices vary considerably between different countries, even within Europe. This page covers some of these
    differences, both on how power is distributed to an installation, as well as how wiring is done inside the
    installation itself.
  </p>

  <h3>Earthing systems</h3>
  <p>
    As mentioned <a href="">previously</a>, the protective earth (ground) is a crucial safety feature in an electrical
    installation, and thus mandatory in most countries around the world.
    However, the actual way an earthing system works can vary substantially, not just between different nations but
    even within the same country, with each system having a different set of pros and cons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Classification of the different types of earthing arrangements is generally done using terminology set by the
    International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC); these are generally divided into three categories: TN, TT and IT.
    TN supplies (that is, ones where the neutral is physically connected to the earth conductor at some point) are then
    subsequently divided into more categories to specify the point at which this connection is made.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that in all of these systems, except for the IT one, the central point of the transformer is connected to
    an earth rod and thus becomes the neutral of the supply. In some countries this is referred to as the "zero"
    point as the neutral is at 0V with respect to earth.
  </p>

  <h4>TN-S supplies</h4>
  <p>
    In these supplies the provided by the electricity supplier in the form of a separate wire going all the way back to
    the transformer, where it is connected to the neutral.
    This system used to be quite common in older houses in the UK, where supply wires had a lead outer covering which was
    used as the protective earth (PE) conductor.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main disadvantage of this system is the high cost, as an entirely separate wire must be supplied; however, it is
    also very safe, compared to TN-C and TN-C-S supplies.
  </p>

  <h4>TN-C supplies</h4>
  <p>
    With this style of earthing a combine neutral and earth (PEN) conductor is used, both for the roles of carrying the
    return current and for the protective earth.
    In a real installation, this means either having a connection inside the appliance from the neutral to the chassis
    (this, of course, necessitates a polarised plug) or, more commonly, there will be a connection behind the socket
    from the neutral to the earth contact.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only advantage of this system is its cheapness: you only need two conductors for a circuit.
    However, there is a huge risk present if the combined neutral and earth is broken at any point: in that case, the
    chassis of the appliance will become live at mains voltage.
    Additionally, this system isn't compatible, or offers very limited protection, when used with RCDs.
  </p>
  <p>
    These days, due to this safety risk, this system is seldom used, however it was allowed until the 90s in the US for
    connecting stoves and dryers (using a 3-wire cord), and was common until the 70s in Germany, where it's sometimes
    called "classical zeroing".
  </p>

  <h4>TN-C-S supplies</h4>
  <p></p>

  <h4>TT supplies</h4>
  <p></p>

  <h4>IT (isolated) supplies</h4>
  <p>
    In these supplies none of the connections on the transformer are connected to earth at any point.
    This means that, in normal conditions, it's impossible to get an electric shock by touching just one wire.
    Because of this safety benefit, these supplies are often used in special situations such as in hospitals, to power
    critical machinery.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of IT supplies is also common in Norway, generally on a 127/220V transformer. This was traditionally
    considered safer, however an isolated system has the problem of being nearly impossible to keep isolated when
    many appliances are connected.
    This, combined with some devices not powering on at all under an IT system, has lead Norway to slowly migrate to
    TN-C-S like other European countries.
  </p>

  <h3>Standard European wall boxes</h3>
  <p>
    The vast majority of countries in Europe use round boxes, which the device is then fixed to either using screws or
    (in older houses) using metal tabs present on the device which push onto the sides of the box.
  </p>
  <p>
    A standard wall-box is only capable of holding one <a href="">Schuko</a> (or French-style) power socket;
    however, larger boxes are available which allow for installing more than one device.
    Installing devices in these boxes is fairly simple, with each device being installed the same way as in a standard
    box and then the appropriate cover plate being fitted on top.
  </p>
  <p>
    The box shown here is a surface-mount type, in this case used on a wooden board to test power meters (hence the
    single insulated wiring - obviously this wouldn't be allowed in an actual electrical installation).
