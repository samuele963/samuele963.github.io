  <h2>General information</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to the online collection of electrical items!
    This website is dedicated to documenting and showcasing electrical items from around the world, both new and old,
    as well as describing how they're installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The general idea behind this site is to get across the characteristics of these items that may not be easy to find
    from a quick search online - for example, photographing items from more angles than just the front.
