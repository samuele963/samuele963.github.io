  <h2>General information</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to the online collection of electrical items!
    This website is dedicated to documenting and showcasing devices used in electrical installations from all over the
    world, both new and old, as well as describing how they're installed and some of the theoretical aspects behind
    these installations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The general idea behind this site is to document these items in their entirety, showcasing what may not
    be easily found or covered elsewhere - for example, by photographing them from different angles to show exactly
    how they're constructed.
