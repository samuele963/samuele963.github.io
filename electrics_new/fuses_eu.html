  <h2>European fuse boxes</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional fuse boxes in Europe could vary considerably between countries; however the most common style, at
    least outside the UK, were the <b>Diazed</b> fuses created in the early 1900s in Germany.
    These used cartridge fuses held in a removable cap that could be unscrewed to change the fuse.
    Later on, the more compact Neozed fuses were introduced, which are still installed nowadays for some special
    applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the UK, on the other hand, the most common style of fuseboxes by far were ones using rewireable fuses.
    These aren't currently in the collection, however rewireable fuses were also often found in some <a href="">
    Italian panels</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Diazed fuse system</h3>
  <p>
    This style of fuses, originally crated in 1906 in Germany by Siemens, was <i>the</i> default in Europe, being
    used for more than half a century. In fact, parts and replacement fuses for existing boards can even be purchased
    today.
    A few different sizes of Diazed fuse exist - DII being by far the most common, with a maximum rating of 25A.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like the fuses used in <a href="">North America</a>, Diazed fuses use an Edison screw socket. However,
    in this case the fuse is a separate cartridge, shaped like a bottle, which then is placed into a cap which is
    what screws into the E27 socket.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fuse cartridges are shaped like a bottle, with the neck having a thicker diameter the higher its rated
    current is. On the other hand, fuse holders have a gauge ring (which can only be removed with a special tool)
    which prevents fuses of a higher current from being used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the fuse is blown, a small spring-loaded button present at the end of the fuse pops out, and can be seen
    from the glass window present in the holder. The colour of the button depends on the rating of the fuse, and
    can also be seen on the gauge ring in the fuse base; the most common colours are red for 10A, grey for 16A and
    yellow for 25A.
  </p>

  <h4>Vintage replacement breaker by Siemens</h4>
  <p>
    This is a vintage replacement breaker meant to be used to replace Diazed fuses. New versions of these are still
    being manufactured and sold nowadays, however this is a very early model, manufactured by Siemens.
    The breaker features a reset button as well as a button to manually turn off the power, as well as some text with
    its rated trip current (6A).

  <h4>DIII three-phase fuse holder</h4>
  <p>
    This vintage fuse holder, by Italian manufacturer Cafrullo, is a three-phase model that accepts DIII fuses up
    to 63A.
    This means that, if used at its rated maximum, it could be used for a 43kW load! However, in the real world,
    this was likely not installed with fuses of that size.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_01.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_01.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_02.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_02.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_03.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/diazed_diii_03.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <p>
    The use of Diazed fuses is a bit odd in Italy, where they weren't common at all; however, they were used for
    industrial applications, which is almost certainly the intended application for this one, especially given its
    maximum rating.
    Notably, this fuseholder doesn't have any sort of way to install a gauge ring - as such, it's possible to
    install fuses of any size in it. Perhaps it was assumed that this was less likely given the intended usecase.
  </p>

  <h3>East German DL fuse holders</h3>
  <p>
    The DL system was a fuse standard specific to the GDR, created as a space-saving successor to the older Diazed
    system, using the smaller E16 socket.<br>
    The design of these fuses is very similar to Neozed D01 ones, however the maximum rating is 20A instead of 16.
    DL fuse cartridges are still being manufactured today for replacements, though unless you're replacing a 20A one
    it makes sense just to buy Neozed fuses instead, as the two systems are so similar that D01 fuses up to 16A will
    fit in DL holders.
  </p>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/dl_01.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/dl_01.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/dl_02.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/dl_02.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <a href="images/fuses_eu/dl_03.jpg"><img src="images/fuses_eu/dl_03.jpg" alt="" class="image"></a>
  <p>
    This bakelite fuse holder, built for the GDR market, is able to hold one DL fuse.
    Opening it up can be done easily, by removing the fuse and then removing the single screw holding the front
    cover on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wiring is also very simple, with screw terminals connecting to the line and load sides of the screw thread, as
    well as a small terminal block for the neutral connection (to which a small remnant of wire can be seen).
