  <h2>German-style "Schuko" plugs and sockets</h2>
  <p>
    The "Schuko" style of plugs and sockets are by far the most commonly used one in Europe, as well as South Korea and
    some parts of Africa and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
    Schuko plugs have pins of 4.8mm diameter, spaced 19mm apart, and a deep recess which makes it impossible to touch
    the live pins of a plug. They're also non-polarised, so they can be inserted in either way, without any distinction
    between line and neutral.
  </p>

  <h3>Standard power socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This is a fairly common example of a Schuko power socket, produced by the German manufacturer Busch-Jaeger.
    The socket mounts to a standard European <a href="wiring.html#wallboxeu">wall box</a>, either using screws or metal
    arms that push outwards, for compatiblity with older installations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Removing the screw on the front lets you take off the front faceplate, exposing the wire connections.
    These are screwless - the wires (solid core only) are installed just by pushing them into the terminals, and they can
    later be released by using a plastic lever, which also covers the live parts of the socket, for safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notably, this socket doesn't have any <a href="safety.html#shutters">safety shutters</a>, as these aren't mandatory
    in Germany. Other countries however, such as Denmark, Norway and Italy, have made shutters a compulsory feature.

  <h3>Socket with shutters</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    Despite the similar appearance, there are some differences between this power socket and the one shown before;
    mounting and installation is essentially the same, however this socket has safety shutters, as well as an older
    style of terminals, which does use screws.
  </p>
  <p>
    These terminals work using a small metal bar, which is raised by tightening a screw, which then pushes the wire
    upwards and forms a stable connection.
    This installation method takes longer than the screwless one shown in the Busch-Jaeger socket, and has thus become
    less common; however, it does enable the use of stranded core wire.

  <h3>Standard Schuko plugs</h3>
  <p>
    Most earthed appliances come fitted with a CEE 7/7 plug, which is compatible with both Schuko and
    <a href="plugs_french.html">French-style</a> power sockets.
    CEE 7/4 plugs, compatible only with Schuko sockets, are nowadays rare to see on appliances, but are commonly
    available in hardware stores in the form of rewireable plugs.
    CEE 7/16 <a href="plugs_other.html#europlugs">Europlugs</a> are also very common, and used for low-powered non-earthed
    devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another commonly found style of plug is the CEE 7/17 "contour plug", which is shaped similarly to a CEE 7/7 one,
    but without an earth connection; this is commonly found on high-power appliances that don't need an earth connection,
    such as hairdryers and space heaters.
    Aside from Schuko and French-style ones, this plug is also safely compatible with <a href="plugs_danish_swiss.html#danish">Danish</a>
    power sockets.

  <h3 id="dualsocket">Dual Schuko socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This power outlet is quite useful, as it allows you to have two sockets in a standard wall box, which normally only
    has space for one. This is done quite cleverly, using the space in such a way as to not have the device protrude
    out of the wall more than necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is achieved by having the contacts placed inside the space of the wall box, so the front cover only has to
    protrude outwards by a small amount, for the recess needed by Schuko sockets.
  </p>

  <h3>Surface-mount IP44 socket</h3>
  <p><i>Rating: 16A 250V</i></p>
  <p>
    This surface-mount power socket is a type commonly found in places like garages, where surface wiring is often used.
    The socket is IP44 rated, which means it can resist light splashes - while not rain-proof, this is perfectly adequate
    for a garage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wiring is quite simple: there are two removable rubber grommets, on the top and bottom of the device, which a hole can be
    punched through for a cable or conduit. The terminals are of the style shown before, with screws.
