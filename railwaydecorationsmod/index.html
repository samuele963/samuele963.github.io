  <h2>Railway Decorations mod for Minecraft 1.19.2</h2>
  <p>
    This is a simple mod, made with the MCreator tool, which adds various decorative blocks (as well as an item used
    to craft them in Survival mode) useful to decorate railway stations in Minecraft.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, the mod adds blocks used for signage, for things like platform numbers, zones, ticket booths, etc.;
    in the future, other types of blocks will be added as well, such as platform edge stripes and decorations for
    the inside of station buildings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: currently the mod is only available for Minecraft 1.19.2 with Forge 43.2.0.
