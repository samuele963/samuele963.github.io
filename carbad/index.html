  <h1>Random thoughts about trains and transit</h1>
  <div class="introduction">
    <p>
      This page will talk about my experiences with train travel in the few train trips I've taken so far that I have
      pictures of. I'll also be comparing it to my normal commute, and how things could be improved to attract more
      people to the idea of going around by train in general.

  <h2>Train travel in South Tyrol</h2>

  <h2>Lessons from Austria: good bus connections</h2>
  <p>
    During the aformentioned trip in South Tyrol I managed to visit Lienz, in Austria, by train.
    This was the first time I had ever been in an Austrian station, and I have to say, I was quite impressed with it.
    The building was modern and clean, and it was very easy to figure out which train to take by looking at the
    displays; plus, it was only a short walk away from the town centre.
  </p>
  <p>
    However what I think struck me the most was how easy and convenient it was for someone to arrive by bus and take
    the train, or viceversa.
    I did not take a bus during that trip, but the bus stop built right into the station building itself was quite
    impressive to me, and clearly showed care and attention for people taking the bus to the station.

  <p>
    The bus terminal felt open and spacious, simply a continuation of the station itself - in fact, as seen from the
    picture platform 1 is directly next to the bus stop: transferring couldn't be easier, and access to the other
    platfoms is of course trivially easy as well.
    The entire thing was screaming "multi-modal mobility", with the train station being much more than that: a
    transportation hub for the entire town, and even neighbouring areas thanks to the bus connections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Often, bus infrastructure is subject to lack of care and attention, even at major transfer points like at train
    stations. Such is the case where I live: bus stops at railway stations only have the usual shed to protect from
    the rain, and transferring requires crossing the road (and thus waiting at a crosswalk).
    It's no wonder that most people travel by car then: transit is clearly not considered a priority, and only there
    because "it has to exist".
