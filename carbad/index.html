  <h1>Random thoughts about trains and transit</h1>

    <p>
      This page will talk about my experiences with train travel in the few train trips I've taken so far that I have
      pictures of. I'll also be comparing it to my normal commute, and how things could be improved to attract more
      people to the idea of going around by train in general.

  <h2>Train travel in South Tyrol</h2>

  <h2>Lessons from Austria: good bus connections</h2>
  <p>
    During the aformentioned trip in South Tyrol I managed to visit Lienz, in Austria, by train.
    This was the first time I had ever been in an Austrian station, and I have to say, I was quite impressed with it.
    The building was modern and clean, and it was very easy to figure out which train to take by looking at the
    displays; plus, it was only a short walk away from the town centre.
  </p>
  <p>
    However what I think struck me the most was how easy and convenient it was for someone to arrive by bus and take
    the train, or viceversa.
    I did not take a bus during that trip, but the bus stop built right into the station building itself was quite
    impressive to me, and clearly showed care and attention for people taking the bus to the station.

    The bus terminal felt open and spacious, simply a continuation of the station itself - in fact, as seen from the
    picture platform 1 was directly adjacacent to the bus stop, meaning that transferring was a simple walk of just a
    few metres.
