  <h1>Random thoughts about trains and transit</h1>
  <div class="introduction">
    <p>
      This page will talk about my experiences with train travel in the few train trips I've taken so far that I have
      pictures of. I'll also be comparing it to my normal commute, and how things could be improved to attract more
      people to the idea of going around using public transport in general.

  <h2>Train travel in South Tyrol</h2>
  <p>
    At the beginning of 2022 I took a short trip to South Tyrol, in Italy. The region is generally considered to have
    among the best public transport in the country and, even though I wasn't able to check out its transit network as
    thoroughly as I would have liked to, what I did see was definitely enough to impress me: the stations were modern,
    clean and wheelchair-accessible; so were the trains themselves, while the service was extremely frequent, taking
    full advantage of the line.
  </p>
  <p>
    I travelled between the stations of Villabassa and Lienz (Austria), on a cross-border regional train run by SAD,
    which operates most of the buses and trains in South Tyrol.
  </p>

  <h3>The line</h3>
  <p>
    The train, originating in <span lang="it">Fortezza</span>/<span lang="de">Franzensfeste</span>, travels along the
    <i lang="de">Pustertalbahn</i> up to the border station of <span lang="it">San Candido</span>/<span lang="de">Innichen</span>
    and then on part of the <i lang="de">Drautalbahn</i> up to Lienz.
    Both lines are entirely electrified, at 3kV DC on the Italian side and 15kV AC in Austria, with trains switching
    between voltages in <span lang="it">San Candido</span>; they are also single-tracked, however with enough passing
    loops to mantain a fairly frequent service.
  </p>
  <p>
    San Candido is also where trains heading to Austria change conductors, with the Austrian section being essentially
    run as an Ã–BB (=Austrian railways) service, just with Italian rolling stock.
    This is likely also why this part of the journey isn't sold on Italian ticket machines: tickets have to be purchased
    on board.
  </p>

  <h3>The service</h3>
  <p>
    However, the impressive part is that, despite the single-tracked line and not particularly high maximum speeds
    (understandable given that this is in the mountains), SAD still operates trains every 30 minutes between
    <span lang="it">Fortezza</span> and <span lang="it">San Candido</span> (and sometimes up to <span lang="de">
    Sillian</span>), with every other train terminating in <span lang="de">Lienz</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Frequencies like these make what would already be a pretty good regional rail system into a truly excellent one -
    trains arrive so often that you might not even need to worry about the timetable, while tourists can move between
    the various towns and ski slopes (which are, in some cases, directly connected to the train stations) without having
    to use a car (a great way to reduce pollution), both of which are features cleverly promoted in the bus and train
    timetable leaflet found at tourist information centres.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="images/VillabassaStation1.jpg" class="fullsizeimage">
    <figcaption>
      The station in <span lang="it">Villabassa</span> is very modern, with an indoors waiting area, covered bike parking and full accessibility.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>The trains</h3>
  <p>
    Service is carried out using Stadler FLIRT multi-voltage trains (ETR 170), capable of operating both under the
    3kV DC used in Italy and the 15kV AC used in Austria. These trains have only entered service fairly recently and
    as such have a very modern interior, with wide windows, accessible toilets, information LCDs, bike and ski storage
    (very important especially given the amount of tourists in this area) and separate recycling bins.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also difficult not to notice the ample amount of spaces dedicated to wheelchair users and prams, most of which
    have foldable seats inside of them so they can alternatively be used as a standard seating area.
    In general, it's evident that much care and attention has been given to accessibility on the line: all the stations
    (minus the one in <span lang="it">San Candido</span>, which is planned to be moved closer to the centre) are
    accessible and the trains of course feature step-free access.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <h3>The stations</h3>
  <p>
    As with the rolling stock, the stations on this line are also modern and well-kept. The platforms are 55cm high, to
    allow for level boarding, and elevators are present for wheelchair users, prams, people with suitcases and anyone
    that wants to use them (accessibility features can be useful for a whole number of users, not just people in
    wheelchairs).
  </p>
  <p>
    Signage is of course bilingual, with station names being written both in Italian and German, and train announcements
    are in both languages as well.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <p>
    So, what can we learn from the trains in South Tyrol? Two things are present here which make this line truly great,
    and which any public transit service must have in order to be useful to the public and thus successful:
    <b>frequency</b> and <b>user experience</b>.
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <b>Frequency:</b> to compete with cars, which are inherently much more flexible at going from A to B than public
    transport, trains (and transit in general) must run very frequently - often enough that missing the train simply
    results in a mild inconvenience rather than leaving you stranded for hours.
    The fact that this single-tracked railway line in the mountains has better frequencies than what generally exists
    between cities with much larger populations in the rest of Italy is telling of how far we still need to go in
    improving service here.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>User experience:</b> transit must also be comfortable (both the vehicles themselves and the stations) and usable
    by everyone (good accessibility is very important). This means having adequate shelter from the rain and summer
    heat (this last point is often overlooked), adequate parking for bicycles and easy to use ticket machines and displays.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This line essentially does all of those things: the service is frequent and convenient to use; the stations are new
    and accessible. Unsurprisingly, this meant that there were a lot of people taking the train, even in Villabassa,
    which only has a population of 1600.
  </p>
  <p>
    My only complaints were with the ticketing system: not being able to buy the tickets for the Austrian section on
    the Italian ticket machines is quite annoying and confusing for the end user; and there was no indication (not even
    a sign) that they had to be purchased on board of the train. We had to ask someone working there, which is certainly
    not ideal.
    Additionally, the only ticket machine in Villabassa was out of service; it was interesting however to see that the
    machines let you buy both train and bus tickets, quite a useful feature.
  </p>
  <p>
    But that's, essentially, the only major complaint I had about the trains there. Everything else was pretty nice,
    with only a few minor improvements that I could think of, like using larger displays for the departures board
    at the stations (the standard ones used throughout Italy can only fit half the number of displayed trains when
    accomodating for the bilingual station names).

  <h2>Lessons from Austria: good bus connections</h2>
  <p>
    During the aformentioned trip in South Tyrol I managed to visit Lienz, in Austria, by train.
    This was the first time I had ever been in an Austrian station, and I have to say, I was quite impressed with it.
    The building was modern and clean, and it was very easy to figure out which train to take by looking at the
    displays; plus, it was only a short walk away from the town centre.
  </p>
  <p>
    However what I think struck me the most was how easy and convenient it was for someone to arrive by bus and take
    the train, or viceversa.
    I did not take a bus during that trip, but the stop being built right into the station building itself was quite
    impressive to me, and clearly showed care and attention for people using buses to get to the station.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="images/LienzStation1.jpg" class="fullsizeimage">
    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The bus terminal felt open and spacious, simply a continuation of the station itself - in fact, as seen from the
    picture platform 1 is directly next to the bus stop: transferring couldn't be easier, and access to the other
    platfoms is of course trivially easy as well.
    The entire thing was screaming "multi-modal mobility", with the train station being much more than that: a
    transportation hub for the entire town, and even neighbouring areas thanks to the bus connections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Often, bus infrastructure is subject to a lack of care and attention, even at major transfer points like at train
    stations. Such is the case where I live: bus stops at railway stations only have the usual shed to protect from
    the rain, and transferring requires crossing the road (and thus waiting at a crosswalk).
    It's no wonder that most people travel by car then: transit is clearly not considered a priority, and only there
    because "it has to exist".
  </p>
  <p>
    This station, however, provides an excellent experience for any transit rider, protecting them from the rain and
    summer heat and also making transfers extremely easy.

  <h2>Image gallery: taking the train in Slovenia</h2>
  <p>
    While Slovenian trains may not be very fast (or frequent), they're a wonderful way to explore the scenery of this
    amazing country. These photos were taken (at different times) on the very scenic Transalpina Railway, mainly used
    by diesel-powered local trains.
