  <h1>Random thoughts about trains and transit</h1>
  <div class="introduction">
    <p>
      This page will talk about my experiences with train travel in the few train trips I've taken so far that I have
      pictures of. I'll also be comparing it to my normal commute, and how things could be improved to attract more
      people to the idea of going around by train in general.

  <h2>Train travel in South Tyrol</h2>
  <p>
    At the beginning of 2022 I took a short trip to South Tyrol, in Italy. The region is generally considered to have
    among the best public transport in the country and, even though I wasn't able to check out its transit network as
    thoroughly as I would have liked to, what I did see was definitely enough to impress me: the stations were modern,
    clean and wheelchair-accessible; so were the trains themselves, while the service was extremely frequent, taking
    full advantage of the line.
  </p>
  <p>
    I travelled between the stations of Villabassa and Lienz (Austria), on a cross-border regional train run by SAD,
    which operates most of the buses and trains in South Tyrol.

  <!-- The line -->
  <p>
    The train, originating in <span lang="it">Fortezza</span>/<span lang="de">Franzensfeste</span>, travels along the
    <i lang="de">Pustertalbahn</i> up to the border station of <span lang="it">San Candido</span>/<span lang="de">Innichen</span>
    and then on part of the <i lang="de">Drautalbahn</i> up to Lienz.
    Both lines are entirely electrified, at 3kV DC on the Italian side and 15kV AC in Austria, with trains switching
    between voltages in <span lang="it">San Candido</span>; they are also single-tracked, however with enough passing
    loops to mantain quite a good level of service.
  </p>
  <p>
    San Candido is also where trains heading to Austria change conductors. Oddly enough, tickets for the Austrian section
    have to be purchased on board.

  <!-- The service -->
  <p>
    However, the impressive part is that, despite the single-tracked line and not particularly high maximum speeds
    (understandable given that this is in the mountains), SAD still operates trains every 30 minutes between Fortezza
    and San Candido, with every other train terminating in Lienz.

  <h2>Lessons from Austria: good bus connections</h2>
  <p>
    During the aformentioned trip in South Tyrol I managed to visit Lienz, in Austria, by train.
    This was the first time I had ever been in an Austrian station, and I have to say, I was quite impressed with it.
    The building was modern and clean, and it was very easy to figure out which train to take by looking at the
    displays; plus, it was only a short walk away from the town centre.
  </p>
  <p>
    However what I think struck me the most was how easy and convenient it was for someone to arrive by bus and take
    the train, or viceversa.
    I did not take a bus during that trip, but the bus stop built right into the station building itself was quite
    impressive to me, and clearly showed care and attention for people taking the bus to the station.
  </p>
  <figure>

  </figure>
  <p>
    The bus terminal felt open and spacious, simply a continuation of the station itself - in fact, as seen from the
    picture platform 1 is directly next to the bus stop: transferring couldn't be easier, and access to the other
    platfoms is of course trivially easy as well.
    The entire thing was screaming "multi-modal mobility", with the train station being much more than that: a
    transportation hub for the entire town, and even neighbouring areas thanks to the bus connections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Often, bus infrastructure is subject to a lack of care and attention, even at major transfer points like at train
    stations. Such is the case where I live: bus stops at railway stations only have the usual shed to protect from
    the rain, and transferring requires crossing the road (and thus waiting at a crosswalk).
    It's no wonder that most people travel by car then: transit is clearly not considered a priority, and only there
    because "it has to exist".
  </p>
  <p>
    This station, however, provides an excellent experience for any transit rider, protecting them from the rain and
    summer heat and also making transfers extremely easy.
