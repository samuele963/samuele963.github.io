  <h1>Taking the train in Slovenia</h1>
  <p>
    While Slovenian trains may not be very fast (or frequent), they're a wonderful way to explore the scenery of this
    amazing country. These photos were taken (at different times) on the very scenic Transalpina Railway, mainly used
    by diesel-powered local trains.

      A train waiting at the station; this line is entirely unelectrified and single-tracked.
      This station is also connected to Italy, however that section of track is only used by freight.

      Another local train, waiting to depart at <span lang="si">Bohinjska Bistrica</span>. As with most of the stations on
      the Slovenian network, to go between platforms you have to physically cross the tracks.
